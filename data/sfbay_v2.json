After a tree is removed due to storm damage or urban development Arbor Upcycle will strive to salvage the tree for its timber. The tree is then milled into slabs on-site or at our warehouse. The 3\u201d wood slabs are then stickered and set aside to cure until they are stable enough to build with or sell.Every piece is identified by its true species and neighborhood in San Francisco where the tree once stood.Arbor Upcycle is not only salvaging valuable timber and sequestering carbon off-gassing but also reclaiming some of San Francisco\u2019s oldest residing residents and in doing so is preserving SF\u2019s heritage in the face of a rapidly changing urban landscape.Next time you need a tree removed or see a tree being removed we hope you think of Arbor Upcycle and our mission to sustainably manage our urban forest and contribute to our community.    http://arborupcycle.com/"

No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"
