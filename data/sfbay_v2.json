It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

We can walk you through the entire process. First timers no need to be anxious, this is supposed to be FUN. The #1 comment customers say is \u201cWow it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought, I\u2019m glad you told me to try it\u201d   We aren\u2019t in the furniture business. We are in the heirloom conversation piece business. Each and every wood slab is unique in it\u2019s own way. Our job is complete when we here a \u201cbing\u201d and see a photo come through of you standing proudly by your masterpiece. We don\u2019t call it quits when you drive away from our facility.  My heart is full of gratitude as I continue reflect on the salvaged material we have provided to our customers over the years. Thank you to everyone that has consciously chosen to purchase the foundation of their project from us . My partners and I invest so much heart into recycling mother nature\u2019s artwork and it is an indescribable feeling to have you guys recognize both the beauty and the effort put forth to give these logs a second life. It is so special for us to be a part of your story. Making the decision to spend your hard earned money on something we worked tirelessly to provide is not something we take lightly or for granted. We appreciate you! STACK EM\u2019 UP!!-Eric Christopher                            Process1. Decide on a project2. Measure the designated available space, keeping in mind the sizes of other nearby objects. Keeping things proportional will help your space feel sophisticated & curated rather than out of place or overbearing.3. Come Look! The fun begins here! Everyone\u2019s taste is different so it\u2019s best to complete steps 1 & 2 and then come look at our inventory and see if anything screams \u201cTake me home\u201d Our inventory is constantly changing. I tell customers \u201cour store is like a shoe store. We don\u2019t always have every size/model/color but it might be tomorrow that we bring the desired material in. Our inventory is based on the trees we are able to give a second life to, not the \u201cclick of a button\u201d reorder.4. Price is based on many factors as each boule is unique in it\u2019s own way and each boule is in a different state of its life. The main factors we consider are:-Size (board foot aka volume of material)-Species -Figure-Moisture content-Raw or SurfacedOnce Home 1. Decide on the aesthetic look you want to achieve. Do you want the piece to be rustic or lean towards a clean \u201cscuplted\u201d look?2.Remove the bark. We like to use a \u201ccats paw\u201d and a mallet, working pieces off as large as possible. For hardwoods a draw knife works well.3.Sand, scuplt, and clean-up the edges (if that follows suit towards your desired look. ) If a rustic look is desired you may wish to leave the edge as is.  4.Sand the top & bottom. We generally start at 60 grit, working our way through the grits until at least 400 grit. THIS IS NOT a requirement, just our preference. The higher grits do not only make the wood fibers smoother, they allow the true beauty of the wood to expose itself. The 3D figure is more pronounced and shows a higher level of visual contrast. Some figured woods we sand 1200+ grit. THE FINISH YOU CHOOSE MAY DICTATE WHAT GRIT YOU STOP SANDING AT. Some finish brands call for designated end points wich are usually lower in grit than our preference of 400 grit. Many require a max of 220 grit. Read manufactures directions to see if they specify. Once sanded up to 100 grit we like to then cut ends to size if needed, then continue sanding working our way up through the grits. We sand a bit before cutting to size because it makes for less friction on the saw, which usually helps make a smooth, clean cut.We blow off the slab with compressed air and wipe the entire slab with a tac cloth to remove loose dust, prepping the slab for its finish stage.For more information Contactphone  Website: www.EricChristopherArt.comemail Eric@ErichChristopherArtFb @EricChristopherArtIg @EricChristopherArtAddress:5325 Gravenstein Highway NorthSebastopol, CA 95472"

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

It was the stock speaker in a Fender Mustang 3 v2 amp that was never gigged. I couldn't even play it over volume level 4 at home without rattling the windows so I put  lower wattage speaker in the amp that  gives me more nuance at lower volume and breaks up sooner."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
