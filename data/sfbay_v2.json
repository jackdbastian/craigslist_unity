This is a well taken care of example of a Huracan. Rare Rosso Mars red exterior, flawless paint with no dings or dents whatsoever. Interior is also in great shape!The downside is that it has a rebuilt title. The car was involved in an accident and had front right corner damage. It was fixed by a reputable shop in Sacramento with all OEM parts used on the repair. Feel free to search the VIN to see the damage or I can send you a link and photos. The damage was light and the vehicle still started, although it was still a very expensive repair due to the cost of Lamborghini parts. I am willing to tow the car up to 500 miles in an indoor car trailer. The car is located in Sacramento. Asking $169,000. Title in hand. Willing to trade for a 2016+ Mercedes GT-R, Lamborghini Aventador or Ferrari (cash on top for appropriate trades)-Gene"

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5250 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.

                "description": "VINTAGE - Jackson J-90 C USA Pickup  This is the highly coveted Jackson J-90 C pickup that came out on Charvel model guitars in the mid 1980s. It looks to be an early edition. This came out of my Charvel Model 2 it is labeled J-90C The C meaning that it has a ceramic magnet. This was the ultimate pickup back in the day. These were made by hand in the Jackson USA factory and many were hand wound by the famous Abigail Ybarra who also went on to work for the Fender Custom Shop. The lead is approximately 10.5 inches long."
