Next 3 pics are photos of the dress on me. Spent a ton on the dress, nothing on the photographer. Big mistake!Since it is a corset back, it's difficult to get the exact measurements of the dress - it has an inch or so give in either direction.It has a thread to mark where the dress can be tied up in the back when you don't want a train anymore.It was only worn once, the day of my wedding. I absolutely loved the dress, and should have gotten more pictures the day-of of the back of the dress!AlterationsThe dress was taken in to fit me better. The measurements given above are the measurements of the dress currently, not pre-alteration."

There is yellowing on the underarm fabric and the hem in front is dirty as shown. I do not know if these stains will come out. The dress has a sweetheart neckline and a corset back. Side seam-to side seam at the bust (front) is approximately 16 but the back can be tied loosely or tightly. The total length from shoulder strap to hem is approximately 74. Material is 100% polyester.\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u27bd Please call/text   or email (preferred) anytime.

Condition is great.Engineered for one of the greatest players of all time, the Wilson Pro Staff RF97 Autograph 2018 plays just like the previous two versions, but has been dressed up with a tuxedo cosmetic. Our team decided this would be the perfect opportunity to expand the playtest to Europe and Australia to get a global perspective on this surgical weapon. The Pro Staff RF97 Autograph impressed our playtesters at the baseline with its plow through, stability, feel and control. From all corners of the world, our playtesters raved about this racquet's stability at the net, and several players called it one of the best volleying racquets on the market. Although serves and returns proved more demanding for some, our testers loved what this racquet had to offer once they got used to its heavier feel. For this playtest our team strung the racquet with Federer's favorite string, Wilson's Champion's Choice, as well as a full bed of poly. By the end of this playtest everyone was happy to report that this racquet remains one the best options available for advanced, big-swinging players.https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/reviews/PRF97A/PRF97AReview.htmlHead Size: 97 sq. in MPLength: 27 inchesWeight: Strung \u2014 12.6 oz / 357 g Tension: 50-60 PoundsBalance: 9 Pts Head LightBeam Width: 21.5 / 21.5 / 21.5 mmComposition: Graphite braided with aramidFlex: 68Grip Type: Babolat Syntec ProString Pattern: 16 Mains / 19 CrossesTwo PieceNo Shared HolesSwing Weight: 335"

No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. Moving must sell!This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"

                "description": "ALL tube amps were built to be serviced every 10-15 years. If a vintage amp hasn't been serviced since it was new, it's time. Or if it's just making too much noise I can fix that too. There is no reason an old Fender can't run stone quiet if serviced properly and fixed in the traditional fashion with the right parts. Specializing in vintage amps, I service them the way that preserves value and maximizes tone. If your amp is 40 or 50 years old, there is no reason it can't run another 40 or 50 years. If it worked right once, it can work right again.If your vintage amp is needed to gig regularly and provide your income, I can also skip some of the vintage schtick and make it bulletproof with all new parts. That's up to you.If you have a re-issue I'm also happy to take a look. Lots can be done to help a printed circuit board amp sound better, or just be serviced as all tube amps routinely require. However, unlike a vintage amp that can be fixed even if it's blown to bits, fixing a blown to bits printed circuit board is usually not worth it. General Prices Vintage Amps (handwired)-Basic service of 40 watts or lower amp is $125+cost of parts-Above 40 watts $180+ cost of parts-Add $40 to above prices for printed circuit board amps.(Some prices may vary slightly for odd situations)If your old Fender needs more than basic service, like the board is conductive or has moisture damage, a full re-build/refurbish can cost you, but it's well worth preserving the old parts if they can be salvaged and still sound great. Don't let some tech tell you ALL the caps are bad or ALL the tubes are bad. Usually not the case, that is a bunch of malarky techs use to make money. This is a side gig for me, I don't need to eek out another 100$ to eat.Services include;Voicing the ampTube socketsElectrolytic capsBad pots fixed or replacedReverbNo signal/No soundTransformer replacement3 prong cord changed (at your discretion)Tubes tested and replaced where needed (usually not all of them need it)Speaker swapsBad JacksMany other repairs...What makes me different;1. I didn't learn this on the internet, where more than half the information out there is just silly folklore.2. I do this because I love it. I have a real job, and don't NEED to do it.3. I'm a musician, and I can hear a lot of nuance that a plain old electrician can't. I know what TONE is. I'm willing to listen to your tone as well, and help you find your own tonal nirvana. 4. Although I'm not above doing mods, if your amp has been modded to kingdom come over many years, you may find putting it back to original stock sounds better. 95% of the time, that's just how it is. I love putting a chop job back to stock and blowing it's owner's mind.5. I don't mark up parts. I only charge cost for parts. For new tubes, given their fickle nature I provide you with direct sources. That way if there is an issue with a defective new tube you can deal directly with the seller for a replacement. I'll be happy to re-bias the amp at no charge after new tubes get replaced should that be the case.I have a very large assortment of vintage tubes if you would like to roll a few through your amp for some different tones. No problem. My location allows you to play as loud as you want.I stand behind all my work and any vintage tubes for 90 days, sometimes more if a minor previously undetected issue arises. Send me any questions. I can take emergency cases if I'm available for a small rush fee.

These were used as musical percussion instruments for various rites and ceremonies.  The Sistrum first appeared in the Old Kingdom and became connected to the goddesses Isis and Hathor.  Unfortunately very few exist.  Most of the surviving ones come from the Greco-Roman era.  It\u2019s closest modern equivalent is the tambourine and is used the same way.   The Sistrum has a long handle, a frame with crossbars and small disks that rattle when shaken.  They were made of wood, stone or metal.  The word Sistrum means that which is being shaken.  The Egyptians believed that the Sistrum had magical properties. It is connected with the powers of the Goddess and symbolizes joy, fertility and eroticism.  It was believed that the Sistrum could avert the flooding of the Nile.  One of the most famous depictions of the Sistrum is in the Hathor Temple in Dendera.  You will also see depictions of the Goddess Isis with a symbol of inundation in one hand and a Sistrum in the other.
