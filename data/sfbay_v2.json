It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

I replaced the tubes a while ago and never really played the amp much after that so they are still in good condition. The speaker is not the original speaker but it still sounds good. Comes with a built in tuner, over 400 preset effects, and 36 programmable channels for custom effects. No switch pedal included.Bring your own electric guitar if you want to test it out in the garage before you buy."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."
