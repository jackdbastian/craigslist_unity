Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."

Very FAST and transparent EL84 cathode biased amp. Beautiful harmonic distortion without NFB. No tradesThe Ceriatone TW series represents our take on yet another famous, rare amplifier line from the United States.The Ceriatone C-Wreck is heavily inspired by an interesting collaboration between the builder of the aforementioned line and another great modern American amp builder.  In topology, it has many similarities to the Rock It!, however we feel this is a further refinement of the design.  The C-Wreck offers a slightly different feel and perhaps an even more satisfying overdriven tone.  As with the Rock It!, the clean and mildly overdriven tones are second to none.Like the other amplifiers from this builder, much of the brilliance in the design is in its simplicity and no-compromises approach to component placement, lead dress, and trying to maintain as unaltered a signal path as possible.  We have kept this approach, but allowed flexibility by offering two different output transformer primary impedances for slightly different feel and harmonic content.Like other Ceriatone amps, we have labored carefully to select the finest components to suit the design, and the Expression uses our specially designed and correct specification custom transformers for superior reliability, frequency response, and feel.Head Dimension : 18.75 x 9.5 x 10.75 inches / Actual Weight : 16kgPower Output\t30 WattFeature Overview\tSingle channelVolume, Treble, Bass, Cut, and Master Volume Controls3-way Bright SwitchHalf Power switch (removes a pair of EL84s and simultaneously rebiases)Fast / Warm Select (selects between high or low plate voltage)Tubes\tPower: 4 x EL84Preamp: 3 x 12AX7/ECC83Rectifier: 5AR4 / GZ34#DR Z #Matchless #Vox #Bad Cat #Two Rock #Fender #Marshall #Mesa #Boutique #HiWatt #AC30"
