BD Loops - Exit Loop - 6' X 12' Direct Burial Performed Loops with 100' Lead  Used for installations under concrete, asphalt, pavers, or gravel roads. The most common installation is the loop tied directly to the rebar before concrete is poured. Wire is UL 493 certified designed for a direct burial application.Unlike loops wrapped through PVC, The BD Loops Direct Burial Loop does not have an air pocket resulting in fewer repeat service calls due to phantom detections caused by ground vibration. Built with a high quality solid 14AWG wire out performing other preformed loops with twice as much copper per foot and increased tensile strength.Solid 14AWG wire also results in the direct burial loop being very ridged giving the installer the opportunity to easily set-up and layout the loop and prevents the loop from falling in-between the rebar patter. Twisted jacketed lead-in prevents \u201ccoil back\u201d from normal twisted lead-in, preventing wasted time untangling lead-in wires. The loop wire has arrows indicating the direction of current allowing easy understanding of phasing.Each direct burial loop comes with an installation kit including easy to understand instructions, cable ties for installation on top of redbar, ground stakes for under gravel roads, and stickers for easy identification after the loops have been installed.            Feature\tBenefitsThicker 14-gauge loop wire, 4 times more copper than 20-gauge wire.\tMore copper means a better performing loop and increased tensile strength.UL 493 Direct burial rated loop wire.\tInsurance the right product is being used for the job resulting in an immense lifespanLoops sold as a kit.\tSupplied instructions, ground stakes, cable ties, and loop labels.Pre-phased at the factory.\tSaves time and prevents confusion when installing two loops to one detector.Soldered connections\tEnsure top performance over time.Flex yoke design pre-fitted with \u00bd inch PVC coupler.\tSaves installation time and material cost.No air pocket in loop wire design.\tWill not float to surface during a concrete pour and also eliminates faults trips due to ground vibrations.Compact size and reduced weight.\tSaves on shipping cost and warehouse space."

These have a 100% fur lining 15% nylon fourchette and were made in the Philippines according to the tag in the left glove. The fur lining is luxuriously soft and is a mix of browns, grays, and white. I believe the letter B is the size. The gloves are approximately 10 long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening. They are in very excellent cosmetic condition with just a few small blemishes as shown.------Please call, text, or email anytime.Thank you,Ed"

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

These were only made for a short time: 1981 - 1983It was serviced by Pete Cage last year, he replaced the hard-wired speaker cable with a 'proper' speaker out  which looks factory. Has the original vinyl Cover and original speaker. There are no rips, stains, tears.  The preamp tubes are GE 12ax7a's.  Pete said the power tubes are Sylvania 6VGT's with the Fender Logo.  When I had it serviced he put everything he replaced in a baggie and gave it back to me.  Once I got it back from him it sounded better than ever - it's a very complex clean tone with no noise or hash.Such a great clean tone at comfortable home volumes and it will also get loud. Doesn't break up much beyond crunch with my Les Paul unless you pull the mid boost.$70 - Eminence GA10-SC64 10 20-Watt 8 Ohm Replacement Speaker          This speaker is in pristine condition. It was installed for a couple of weeks and carefully taken out          (stored in a box). No issues of any kind."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Antonio Marin Montero is the patriarch of guitar building in Granada, Spain. He is famous for his impeccable craftsmanship and warm, sweet, lyrical sound and superlative playability. This is an excellent example of his flamenco guitars from what many believe to be his best period of building, the 80\u2019s-90\u2019s. The German Spruce top is of master grade quality with fine straight grain and strong medullary rays. The Spanish Cypress back and sides is also of the top quality that is rare to find now. It has a very flamenco sound, is well balanced, lightweight and responsive, with macho basses, strong midrange, and bell-like trebles. Condition is excellent, with only a couple of cracks (shown in the photos) that were expertly repaired by German Vazquez Rubio. Low action, 650mm scale. $6000 obo"

                "description": "Selling a mint-condition MXR CSP102SL Script Dyna Comp Reissue pedal in original box. This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades. Will accept cash, PayPal, or Venmo. Local buyers only. Good luck"
