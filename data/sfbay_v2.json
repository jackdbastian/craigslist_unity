It was purchased for $2100, worn only once, and has been dry cleaned after the wedding.  Only alternations made to the dress are added cups for bra support, and the tailor brought in the sides a little bit around the waist and upper torso.  The dress color is ivory over nude.The dress is the original length since my wife is 5'9, so there was no hemming needed!  We will also include a veil ($200+tax) and adjustable petticoat, both purchased new and worn only once.The attached pictures are the actual photo of the dress worn on the day of the wedding.  I've also attached a few online pictures found in the following link containing more information about the dress: https://www.theknot.com/fashion/samantha-v1606-ivoire-by-kitty-chen-wedding-dressThanks for looking!"

                "description": "2004 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Generation 2. It has faded paint. Please view all the pictures. Runs great. The engine is super quiet and purrs like a sewing machine. Clean title196,010 original milesCatalytic converter guard protection (anti-theft cat shield)LeatherPower windowsPower door locksPower mirrorsCruise controlLED headlightsCold A/CUpgraded stereo and speakersSmog just completed for the sale 07/20/2021Current registration With 196k miles, it runs amazing but is certainly isn't a looker. It has a few dings and scratches and most notably, the paint is fading due to age. Mostly on the left side and on the rear bumper. Also, there are a few random drops of paint on the right side. (A homeless guy decided to do his art project next to it a few years back. sigh..) If you're patient, you can get it off without damaging the paint but it takes a long time and I simply don't have the patience. Again, please look at ALL the pictures. If you're looking for a pretty car, this is not it. If you're looking for a very reliable and great running Prius, this is it!On a positive note, The hybrid battery is very healthy and charges to the full green hash mark. And, the leather interior looks like it just came off the showroom floor. Absolutely gorgeous! Yet again, please view all the pictures.$3900 Firm. I've priced it fairly for someone looking for a great commuter. Please e-mail and include your phone number and availability. Thank you."

                "description": "BEST IN CLASS PORTABLE DIGITAL PIANO. LIKE NEWIt has been casually practiced on for 1 year, after that no more time to play. I personally loved * the PHA-50 keys actions feel almost like acoustic piano's (this is the same keys in Roland's LX708 model for $6000+ that comes w/ 10 years warranty so it is really durable, wood, long key for control, weight like acoustic pianos, 100 level of touch sensitivity, ivory feel, escapement and triple sensors) * Supernatural sound modeling engine, not from sound sampling. So many nuisances are noticeable and many effects (like lid, types of soundboard, hammer sound, reverb, etc) are editable (FP-90X upgraded the engine a bit but I personally can't tell the difference)* speaker is 60W, loud enough for medium venue and performancesee overview and reviews herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aGzcCjVVPA&t=3shttps://www.roland.com/us/products/fp-90/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St14HPA6Wighttps://www.pianodreamers.com/roland-fp90-review/see price comparisons here: https://www.adorama.com/rofp90bkc.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0K-HBhDDARIsAFJ6UGiX-l8LEFzODtq3yZjDLcYeSYz5JJ5jL1RL0FY6k5XJ6zzVfixeXIYaAiDAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&utm_source=nmpi-google-dsa-newhttps://www.guitarcenter.com/Roland/FP-90-Digital-Piano-Black-with-Stand-and-Pedal-Board-J45588.gchttps://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1298892-REG/roland_fp_90_digital_piano_kit.htmlhttps://www.amazon.com/ROLAND-88-keys-Digital-Pianos/dp/B01MQDY2JB (amazon has no stand)It is heavy ~90 lb. pls bring a friend to carry with you if needed.

                "description": "Since you see this ad now, it means that Deep Mind 12 is STILL AVAILABLE.Behringer's famous first analog synth, Deep Mind 12. True analog, 12-voice poly, 4x effects engines, 8x modulation matrix, 1024 patches onboard. Commonly known as Juno on steroids, the modern incarnation of Juno-106 (for the look and bunch of buttons and sliders), it's actually closer to more advanced Juno-60 and JX series. Think JX-10 with all these Juno sliders and  a PG-800 programmer built in. I had and have most of classic analog polysynths, the last one was JX-10 with Vecoven upgrade (cost me over $1300), but even that one doesn't come close to DM12 in sound, features and ease of use. Nothing can beat the feeling of just grabbing a slider and adjusting the value right away, instead of recalling parameter first, then adjusting it, then recalling another, like on JX. You can even play with two or more sliders at once, like cutoff and resonance. There's no way you can do it on any JX.12-voice polyphony does make the difference, you'll never have cut notes as it happens with 6-voice synths like Juno, JX-8P or Polysix.DM12 is analog fanatics' heaven: everything you wished an old Juno or JX had is here, already implemented. IMHO it's the dream analog polysynth: plenty of sliders on surface for instant tweaking like on Junos and Jupiters, and a large graphic display for in-depth editing (no external programmer or software editors are needed). DM12 has a lot more editable parameters than surface allows, so combination of physical sliders for most critical parameters and on-screen menus for everything else is the best, like for effects parameters (it has no less than 4 separate effects engines made by TC Electronics, makers of legendary studio rack effect units like 2290, M-One and D-Two). Plus, an insane 1024 memories onboard (instead 32 to128 on classics) make it quite usable even for live performances. I'd take it over Nord Lead, Novation Peak or Prophet-6 any day!DM12 are becoming rare, since they are no longer produced, and Behringer now is focusing on producing the exact copies of the classic synthesizers. DM12 is an original design, and while it has a lot of layout and sonic similarities with Junos, it's far more advanced and superior to all of them, in a small package with solid all-metal design.  Watch videos for sound samples, more detailed overview of features and comparisons to classic synths.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynm44MeqPfk&feature=emb_logoVery detailed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8B6HJ2chQThis DM12 is in great shape, practically new, not even a single scratch anywhere. Selling only because I mostly play live and need more universal synth like Kronos or Montage. My price is fair: they are no longer produced and becoming rare (especially in new condition like mine). Be way of online buys: some sellers won't tell you everything, and in case of problems you'll be paying for return shipment anyway, IF seller accepts returns (most don't).Low-ball offers: No reply means that your offer went straight to trash. I don't need to know how much they are on eBay, or that somebody is selling it for less or is willing to give it to you for free: if he does, go and get that one.Thanks for looking!"
