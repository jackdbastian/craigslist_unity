                "description": "Hello,I am selling brand new wood flooring.  It is sustainably harvested 2nd growth Douglas fir from Canada.  It is 1x8 (3/4\u201d x 7\u201d) and I have available about 4000 sq ft in straight 6\u2019 lengths for $4/sq ft plus shipping.  It is all kiln dried to 8-10% moisture content.  Made with a stain or finish ready pre-sanded surface which means you can go right to finishing or staining or oiling after installation with no sanding required. It has a microbevelled edge on the long sides so there is no splintering when nailed down / together.  The ends are mill or butt cut so you can cut the long lengths (no short pieces) to what you need in order to stagger the pattern.  The back side is stress relieved to prevent cupping, crowning, or warping.  It can also be glued for added stability.  Other big flooring companies are selling this type of flooring, albeit some reclaimed or circular sawn (which I also have) for up to $11/ sq ft.... I am selling full lengths for $4.00/ sq ft.   For delivery (with covid / corona virus) I will ship it for a reasonable price to your driveway curb side.  Please have a look at some pictures of it on my Instagram @deltahardwoodsPeople have also used this wideplank fir on ceilings, walls, soffits, and fencing.  It has many uses although it is made to be used as flooring as it has the recess for the nail down staples.I also have matching stair nosing for $12/ft.  Please give me a call or text at   for more info.  Thanks for looking"

Leather brim liner is imprinted with JHats logo in gold, size tag intact - X-Large (7-1/2 - 7-3/4) - fits head circumference 23-1/2 - 24-3/8. Satin-piped brim measures 13\u201d L x 10\u201d W; top, 8-3/8\u201d L x 8-1/8\u201d W x 7\u201d H. It has 2\u201d W satin bow. Graceful shape, tall top hat reminiscent of that worn by Mad Hatter in \u2018Alice in Wonderland.\u2019 Alternately it is quintessential Victorian gentleman's head wear - great for role-playing characters of early 19th - 20th - Dickens's Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, My Fair Lady. Hat is dapper as is but with a little TLC and steam-cleaning it will bring that Victorian era to life. Including a polka-dotted ribbon/bow that might come in handy for Halloween costume. Hat retails elsewhere on-line for at least $60; bargain here. Seller prefers local pick-up in San Rafael. In consideration of social distancing, payment via PayPal, please. Will consider other delivery options in these shelter-in-place times."

It was purchased for $2100, worn only once, and has been dry cleaned after the wedding.  Only alternations made to the dress are added cups for bra support, and the tailor brought in the sides a little bit around the waist and upper torso.  The dress color is ivory over nude.The dress is the original length since my wife is 5'9, so there was no hemming needed!  We will also include a veil ($200+tax) and adjustable petticoat, both purchased new and worn only once.The attached pictures are the actual photo of the dress worn on the day of the wedding.  I've also attached a few online pictures found in the following link containing more information about the dress: https://www.theknot.com/fashion/samantha-v1606-ivoire-by-kitty-chen-wedding-dressThanks for looking!"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
