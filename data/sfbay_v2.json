He is an orchid grower and used it to transport his plants all over the state (mostly freeway miles).  I fixed a few small problems and it's been a solid reliable vehicle for us. It's also an extra vehicle, (we've driven it under 2000 miles in 2 years) and as nice as it was to have it, we don't need it. So time to move it on.Recent repairs/////In the last 2000 miles are-Valve Cover Gaskets (because they were leaking) and Valve Adjustment and new Spark Plugs at that time -Front Axles-Air & Cabin Filters-Transmission drain & fill-Installed a Blue Tooth / phone setup//////In the last 10,000 miles/////-Front Brake Pads and Rotors-Right Rear Wheel Bearing////////////////////////////////////////////The Timing Belt & Water Pump, Bearings + Tensioner were replaced at 115,000 in 2002 (Original Honda Parts) Rear Brakes are better than 50% leftMichelin Tires have about 40% or so leftThe right rear corner has got dinged a couple times (by a couple different people) it's not bad tried to show it. Some wear on the Passengers front seat on the side and armrest and drivers armrest"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "This guitar is a 1970\u2019s Japanese knockoff of a Gibson ES-175. These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."
