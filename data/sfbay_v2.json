It's labeled a size medium (40/42) however underarm to underarm is approximately 22 (44 all around, no stretch) and the length from shoulder to hem is approximately 28.5. This is in previously owned condition but looks very nice. All snaps are present and work as they should, there is also a drawstring at the hem. The care tag text is perfectly legible. There is some light discoloration around the collar as shown as well as tiny blemishes on the front and back as circled. There is no fading or cracking of the Nasa graphics or text.------Please call/text   or email anytime. Pickup in Rohnert Park.Cash or Venmo accepted.

However, selling this in an AS IS condition, as there are a few things that need some work:*Needs either a new catalytic converter or O2 sensor before it would pass another smog test (but current one valid until Sept)*Front bumper needs new screws to attach it to carriage (currently using some duct tape, functional but not pretty)*Tear on leather of Driver's seat*Sun roof doesn't openiVIN Report Summary:This vehicle's market value is $6,544.This vehicle is estimated to have 168,000 miles on the odometer.Projected depreciation: $976 in 5 years."

Due to not working because of the COVID virus  I haven\u2019t the money to fix it.  It is a federal truck and does not need the catalytic converter a sticker on the air filter makes this possible. The truck was a city truck from the city of Concord and serviced in a schedule. The price is as it Is due to fast sale.   Call for appointment to view. Bob"

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5250 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

This instrument sports tea cup knobs which are correct to the antique ones from the past, and look better than the knobs that are normally on these Ignition series guitars, I think. I have not seen the Chinese made Hofner I am selling available, for quite a while.https://www.guitarcenter.com/Hofner/Ignition-Series-Violin-Electric-Guitar.gcFrom Guitar Center's website:The Hofner Ignition Series Violin Electric Guitar is lightweight and easy to love. It features set-neck construction and a full 25.5 scale. The body is made of flamed maple back & sides with a sweet sounding spruce top. Loud enough for acoustic practice, it really shines when plugged in thanks to two mini humbuckers. Hardware includes a floating rosewood bridge with tune-o-matic top for perfect intonation and vintage style tuning machines.

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
