It has controls for bass, treble and volume, it has it's own AC plug, a footswitch-jack and \u00bc\u201d line-out jack. The internal speaker(s) is a massive 15\u201d woofer and high-power handling ferro-fluid treble-driver. Its' rugged solid-state power amp provides long life, reliability and plenty of power for professional applications. It's the same size as (but heavier than) the 122, 147 and 122XB. The 971 is a great sounding leslie and it's available for audition and inspection by appointment. The cabinet is beautiful red-walnut (footswitch will be included with purchase)."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

If you are serious about owning a vintage Hammond, it may be worth the trip for this one.The D-152 is electrically the same as a Hammond B-3.  The difference is that the D-100 series have a built-in amplifier, speakers, and reverb. \u00a0There are adapters available to hook it up to a Leslie, or you could make your own connections.It has the famous Hammond B-3 percussion, the same slide bars, same keyboard, the same pre-sets.Mine has a serial number of 2427, probably manufactured in 1967-1968. \u00a0Originally sold in Eureka, CA.It is over 50 years old, and everything functions. Could use cleaning and up-dating, of course. \u00a0The B-3 percussion sounds great. \u00a0Has a small amount of hum at the loud settings, possibly a pre-amp tube.Has two 12 speakers and two 8 speakers.It is missing the bass pedals. \u00a0The cabinet is in decent condition for its age -- still has a good polish, but does have a few scrapes on the corners.Includes a new unopened bottle of Hammond oil. \u00a0The instructions for modifying the presets are inside, as well as the original cloth bag of extra preset screws. \u00a0(See photos)This would be ideal for someone who wants to make a cut-down portable Hammond B3.Any questions please write. \u00a0Cash, no trades. In Arcata. \u00a0------------------------------------------------Here are some Internet links and info:http://www.tonewheelgeneral.com/agelist/agelist.php \u00a0https://ethw.org/Hammond_B3_Organ \u00a0The B3, C3, A100, A105, RT-3, and D-152 all had the same electronics that produced the famed B-3 sound.The same vibrato, chorus, and 2nd & 3rd harmonic percussion.Model B3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1975)Model B2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from December 1949 through December 1954)Model C3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1975)Model A100 Series \u00a0 (Manufactured from ~1959 through 1965)Note: \u00a0 Model A105 continued to be manufactured until January/February 1975.Model RT3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1974)Model D100 series \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from July 1963 through September 1969)The Cadillac of Hammonds. Tipping the scales at 575 lbs, this beast is just an RT-3 with a built in PR-40 amplifier. \u00a0Just like an A-100 (except better)"
