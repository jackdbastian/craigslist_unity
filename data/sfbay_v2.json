However, selling this in an AS IS condition, as there are a few things that need some work:*Needs either a new catalytic converter or O2 sensor before it would pass another smog test (but current one valid until Sept)*Front bumper needs new screws to attach it to carriage (currently using some duct tape, functional but not pretty)*Tear on leather of Driver's seat*Sun roof doesn't openiVIN Report Summary:This vehicle's market value is $6,544.This vehicle is estimated to have 168,000 miles on the odometer.Projected depreciation: $976 in 5 years."

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible and in total cost over $1500). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5000 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

Previously owner was the original owner and hardly played it, and (shame on me) neither did I, the second owner. My teacher is most famous as a timbales player, so I wanted to take it up. But I realize now that I don't have the bandwidth to pick it up while also learning bongos and congas (not to mention guitar, woodwinds, harmonica...I have a lot of interests!). And now I need to collect funds for a recent surgery. Hence the reluctant sale!Everything is from JCR, except the Bullfrog block (which came with the set when I bought it) and the LP cha-cha bell (which I bought new). Set also comes with the JCR stand, and a couple of non-JCR bags which don't look like they were necessarily for timbales, but they do the job. JCR, the man and master maker, is no longer with us on earth. And neither is his company. So no more JCR timbales are being made. It's hard enough to find one for sale. From what I see online, this is one of the few left in the world in this kind of excellent condition available for sale!"
