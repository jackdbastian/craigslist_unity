Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and the power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height (not too low)*Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"
