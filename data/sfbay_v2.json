Condition is great.Engineered for one of the greatest players of all time, the Wilson Pro Staff RF97 Autograph 2018 plays just like the previous two versions, but has been dressed up with a tuxedo cosmetic. Our team decided this would be the perfect opportunity to expand the playtest to Europe and Australia to get a global perspective on this surgical weapon. The Pro Staff RF97 Autograph impressed our playtesters at the baseline with its plow through, stability, feel and control. From all corners of the world, our playtesters raved about this racquet's stability at the net, and several players called it one of the best volleying racquets on the market. Although serves and returns proved more demanding for some, our testers loved what this racquet had to offer once they got used to its heavier feel. For this playtest our team strung the racquet with Federer's favorite string, Wilson's Champion's Choice, as well as a full bed of poly. By the end of this playtest everyone was happy to report that this racquet remains one the best options available for advanced, big-swinging players.https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/reviews/PRF97A/PRF97AReview.htmlHead Size: 97 sq. in MPLength: 27 inchesWeight: Strung \u2014 12.6 oz / 357 g Tension: 50-60 PoundsBalance: 9 Pts Head LightBeam Width: 21.5 / 21.5 / 21.5 mmComposition: Graphite braided with aramidFlex: 68Grip Type: Babolat Syntec ProString Pattern: 16 Mains / 19 CrossesTwo PieceNo Shared HolesSwing Weight: 335"

No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. Moving must sell!This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"

I bought this in 2016, but shoulder issues are forcing me into a smaller guitar, and I'm mostly playing electric now. Not looking for trades. Happy to answer any questions, but if you're not local, saying you'll just buy it outright w/o playing it, or trying some scam, chances are I'm not responding. I want the new owner to be as happy with it as I've been. If the ad is up, the guitar is available. Thanks!"

These were used as musical percussion instruments for various rites and ceremonies.  The Sistrum first appeared in the Old Kingdom and became connected to the goddesses Isis and Hathor.  Unfortunately very few exist.  Most of the surviving ones come from the Greco-Roman era.  It\u2019s closest modern equivalent is the tambourine and is used the same way.   The Sistrum has a long handle, a frame with crossbars and small disks that rattle when shaken.  They were made of wood, stone or metal.  The word Sistrum means that which is being shaken.  The Egyptians believed that the Sistrum had magical properties. It is connected with the powers of the Goddess and symbolizes joy, fertility and eroticism.  It was believed that the Sistrum could avert the flooding of the Nile.  One of the most famous depictions of the Sistrum is in the Hathor Temple in Dendera.  You will also see depictions of the Goddess Isis with a symbol of inundation in one hand and a Sistrum in the other. All vintage, antique and used items are sold \u201cas found\u201d and are priced accordingly."
