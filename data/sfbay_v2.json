                "description": "This is a 2 owner truck. The original owner had it from 1989 -2014 and babied it. I've had it since then and only used it occasionally on our DIY home remodel for weekend home supply/material runs.It is in super clean condition, all original, no mods, etc. Starts right up on the first crank and runs like new, has a fun amount of power from the V6 and manual transmission. Mechanically sound and well maintained over the years. The interior is super clean, dash has no cracks, seats have no rips. Has a sunroof, xtra cab with small jump seats. Paint is a little faded but could easily be buffed out to shine again. No rust anywhere. AC works well. Sweet original 80's alloy wheels and tires with good tread. Stock exhaust that sounds sporty. Clean title in hand. No accidents/body work etc. Has a tow hitch, though it's never been used to tow by me or the previous owner. Small things that need fixing (or not):passenger side mirror glass fell offtape deck stopped working a couple weeks ago, but radio works fineheater does not blow hot, but the fan motor works. I believe the heater valve, easily accessed in the engine compartment, is faulty it just never bothered me enough to fix it.  key lock for the gas door doesn't work, so I put a locking gas cap on it (still have the original gas door lock if you want to re-key it)passenger side rear window pop lock just broke, it's plastic, and I have it wired shut with a piece of wire. another easy fix.The rear bumper is a little tweaked on one side, but no body/frame damageThe truck originally came with factory gold decals on the sides (part of a sport package maybe?), of which I peeled most of them off (I thought it looked kinda dated when I first got it, but now I wish I had left them for the retro vibe) and you can see the original shiny paint where the stickers where. It took a while to peel those off and I never finished peeling the stickers off the one side the bed. A standard heat gun and credit card/plastic scraper, does the trick. I'm not really sure of value, I see some pretty high prices on here for similar trucks with much higher mileage. If anybody is an expert on these cars, maybe you could offer some advice on how to price this. I\u2019ve been busy and the registration just ran out 2 days ago, end of June, but I will smog it and renew registration before handing it off to the new owner.  See the pictures for condition - **The first picture of the truck it is washed and still **wet**, so you can see what it\u2019ll look look like polished up** The others pictures are after it is dry and the paint is a bit faded looking. If you're **serious** about buying the truck (I'm busy with work, my free time is limited) make contact and include a phone number. You can come see it now/test drive it, but I need to use it for 2 more weeks until our remodel project is finished. Thanks!"

It was fixed by a reputable shop in Sacramento with all OEM parts used on the repair. Feel free to search the VIN to see the damage or I can send you a link and photos. The damage was light and the vehicle still started, although it was still a very expensive repair due to the cost of Lamborghini parts.

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5250 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

As much as I would love to keep it, it really just doesn't make sense for me to keep it any longer.It's loaded with a pair of Celestion Creambacks on the top, and an x pattern of G12H100s and Vintage 30s on the bottom. It's wired for an 8 ohm load.While the cab is in far from perfect cosmetic condition, as you can see in the pictures, it's in perfectly sound physical shape, and it looks great from the front.This cabinet is a real presence at gigs (whenever we get around to having those again) and would really work well for a stoner or doom band that's going for a Sleep/High on Fire-esque stage presence. It also acts as its own monitor in a sense, as the top speakers are so close to ear level that you should never really have an issue hearing yourself.I've used this cab with a lot of different amps, and it makes each one sound amazing. It's also a very loud cab, and it can handle just about anything you can throw at it. I'm honestly sad to see it go, but I would rather sell it to someone that will use it than to have it sit in my studio.The cab comes with casters. I can't remember the exact dimensions off the top of my head, but its something like 56 tall, 32 wide and between 12 and 14 deep. Point is that this won't fit in every car - just something to be aware of.I'm open to trades, but only for a nice 7 string guitar, preferably something metal oriented. will add cash for the right guitar."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
