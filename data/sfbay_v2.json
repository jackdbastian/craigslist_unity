BD Loops - Exit Loop - 6' X 12' Direct Burial Performed Loops with 100' Lead  Used for installations under concrete, asphalt, pavers, or gravel roads. The most common installation is the loop tied directly to the rebar before concrete is poured. Wire is UL 493 certified designed for a direct burial application.Unlike loops wrapped through PVC, The BD Loops Direct Burial Loop does not have an air pocket resulting in fewer repeat service calls due to phantom detections caused by ground vibration. Built with a high quality solid 14AWG wire out performing other preformed loops with twice as much copper per foot and increased tensile strength.Solid 14AWG wire also results in the direct burial loop being very ridged giving the installer the opportunity to easily set-up and layout the loop and prevents the loop from falling in-between the rebar patter. Twisted jacketed lead-in prevents \u201ccoil back\u201d from normal twisted lead-in, preventing wasted time untangling lead-in wires. The loop wire has arrows indicating the direction of current allowing easy understanding of phasing.Each direct burial loop comes with an installation kit including easy to understand instructions, cable ties for installation on top of redbar, ground stakes for under gravel roads, and stickers for easy identification after the loops have been installed.            Feature\tBenefitsThicker 14-gauge loop wire, 4 times more copper than 20-gauge wire.\tMore copper means a better performing loop and increased tensile strength.UL 493 Direct burial rated loop wire.\tInsurance the right product is being used for the job resulting in an immense lifespanLoops sold as a kit.\tSupplied instructions, ground stakes, cable ties, and loop labels.Pre-phased at the factory.\tSaves time and prevents confusion when installing two loops to one detector.Soldered connections\tEnsure top performance over time.Flex yoke design pre-fitted with \u00bd inch PVC coupler.\tSaves installation time and material cost.No air pocket in loop wire design.\tWill not float to surface during a concrete pour and also eliminates faults trips due to ground vibrations.Compact size and reduced weight.\tSaves on shipping cost and warehouse space."

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

Like I've stated before I bought the car with these wheels on so I'm not sure how many miles the motor has but is lower than what is on odometer (I've priced accordingly to the 140k Mile reading)  I am the 3rd owner of the car I bought it from the previous owner who had it sense 20k miles Tire pressure light is on because the 19s have no sensors cheap fix if you want but always kept air in them and never bothered me Clean Title Car runs perfectly I am selling because of job opportunity I've came across in SF need something better on gas and automatic You can contact me at 408 204 90 two nine Thanks - MichaelI do not need help sellingNo trades Lowballers will be ignored"

                "description": "ABOUTThe One Watt Plus amplifier adds more to the popular One Watt model. More Power: The One Watt Plus has a pair of 6V6 tubes running in parallel for 10 watts of clean power, and 18 watts of harmonically rich overdriven power. Onboard power scaling drops the amp from 10 watts down to 1 watt so you can get the grind at bedroom volume with no change in tone. More Speaker: Available as a 12 combo, the One Watt Plus can move as much or as little air as you want it to. A bigger cabinet translates into more overall power. The Jupiter small magnet ceramic is transparent with a scooped sound. Upgrade to a Celestion Alnico Blue, and this amplifier becomes a rock box with added midrange focus and punch. More Class: The One Watt Plus has true Class A, single ended design. Both 6V6 power tubes run in parallel for a very dynamic and touch sensitive playing experience rich with even order harmonics. Three speaker options help tailor the One Watt Plus to your unique style:Celestion Greenback 12 is a transparent sounding speaker. Bright, Lively, and efficient. This speaker has a big bottom even at low volume. This speaker has very little breakup and does not color the amp when driven. Jupiter Alnico 12 has a classic American alnico magnet sound. A bit less transparent in the upper midrange, this speaker adds a woody tone. Its lively on top, and a bit more focused in the bass response than the Greenback. The speaker starts to break up and add alnico character as the amp is pushed. Its the most efficient of the 3 speaker options. VSOP Alnico 12 is warm, buttery smooth, and slightly less loud feeling than the other Alnico options. Its very good for getting the full tone from the amp without disruptive volume levels. Celestion Alnico Blue 12 takes the Pint in a different direction. This speaker is very mid forward with little midrange scoop. The top is bright, and the bass response is the tightest out of the three options. This speaker starts to break up when the amp is driven hard. When the amp is overdriven, the Blue is extremely reactive shedding low end and pushing the midrange further into the fun zone. Like all Milkman amplifiers, the One Watt is hand wired onto a turret board with Mercury Magnetics transformers and Jupiter Capacitors standard. It is built into a custom aluminum chassis and housed in a Pine cabinet."

                "description": "Solid State Fender Princeton Chorus amp for sale. I bought this last year from the original owner but I've since upgraded to a bigger amp. Everything works great and has a great sound. Can get really loud and suffice any practice, club, or bedroom set up. Pretty versatile too. The Princeton Chorus was one of a series of amps Fender released starting in the late '80s that used classic Fender amp names such as Princeton and Champion. This 125-watt solid-state amp featured two 10-inch speakers and an onboard chorus channel."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

This upright piano is from 1970s. We are consolidating rooms at our small music school, and now there are too many instruments in one office. Imagine that the piano has been recently TUNED and regulated.  You'll only need to hire your movers. No stairs in the building Chickering has been  famous for many decades before getting sold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4yfS1bEHz8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SylNUF5510E By the way, in the same room, we have also two Chickering grand pianos, which we use for teaching. You can see how much we are fond of this make!"
