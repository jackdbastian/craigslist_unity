I personally went to New Mexico and Arizona and worked with the Native American Indians for the ring I have available in this ad.  This ring has been in storage and never worn since 1995.  I'm offering the following ring in the 6 1/2 size.  See pictures with ring sizer for exact measurements.The vintage ring I have is Navajo with a sterling silver beaded band.  Not sure what the yellow/amber colored stone is but it has been carved by the artist.  Size is about a 6 1/2. This is probably a 1970's ring.

Beautiful, classy design and warm, but not bulky, thanks to Thinsulate lining.I purchased the gloves early 1990s at Wilsons Leather in SR Plaza. They have not been worn for about 25 years. So, these are officially classic and in excellent condition. The gloves have been stored indoors in a smoke free and pet free home."

This is in perfect condition, I played out with it a few times, but always kept it in good cover during transportation.  A really fine hand-wired powerful 36 watt amp.  I love this thing, but it gets really loud and I don't want to install a master volume.  It's a shame the local manufacturing couldn't keep this a profitable Bay Area amp.  I bought it after the company had closed locally.Read up about it, it's got four EL-84 tubes in the power amp, and two stages, really good cleans, really good grind when you crank it, and tons of articulation/ response from your guitar.  I purchased a couple variations of this amp, and I just don't play on this one enough.  I honestly think it's a bargain for the quality of tone it puts out.  I wanted it to replace my '73 Marshall, (r.i.p.) and it does a fine job.  It would be a shame for me to just keep it and not play on it.  Thanks,Dave  , text or email only please!"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

It is openhole, inline G, C foot and was restored by Daniel Deitch in San Francisco.The sound is warm and sweet and has nothing to do with the volume of the 21st century.It comes in the original case."
