Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and the power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height (not too low)*Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

                "description": "Lucked onto this excellent condition Epiphone guitar during a recent 12 string emergency (had popped a 1/4 TRS hole top of my old 12 !) On this Epi, I did a top quality fret level and action set-up (seriously equipped & skilled luthier) for an audition (laughably talented singer/player) Next I came across the 12 I was really looking for,   plus was able to repair my original 12's top.Would love to keep this Epi but no reason to keep three 12strings in the house.This guitar comes with a very nice like-new hard case (not pictured)or I also have available a vintage built-like-a-tank genuine Epiphone case for an extra $40.Set up , sys I?  This guitar was nearly new & unplayed but never had a pro set up after purchase. It was ripeIn case you never have had the pleasure, a good set up is what makes a decent guitar play like a great guitar.The receipts - Start with a flat neck (truss rod responds fine),flat lap the fret tops on machinst's inpection granite block (seen below)Re-crown the frets with a diamond Z file. Scrub and oil fretboard. Replaced OE nut with a new black GRAPHTECH blank  (original nut included). Correct set of nut files used to set string height at 1st fret, ~0.016 acrossWith a block-flattened fret job (that block is flat to like 6 decimal places!) you can set very low 1st fret & 12th fret actions and low relief. This makes a fast fingering flat picked 12, loud and sizzling. Plays as easy as many great 6'sI rolled over the bridge corner, for hard strumming styleThe DR212 is built like a tank and rings like bell, a go anywhere guitar that New strings not yet installed as final set up details will evolve according to new owners choice.Currently set up in medium 12-54 set, the fret job will shine under a light set ( haha) but if you have a preference, I will include final set up. Plays fantastic as is and you might just want to run with it"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "1930s Oscar Schmidt stencil guitar featuring a Hawaiian scene.Solid birch\u2014the shape and silhouette is quite like their famous Stella. It has that deep, satisfying sound too.There are some repaired cracks along the upper bout, scuffs and stencil discoloring, but generally the guitar is in great shape. Stamped on the top of the headstock is \u201cFATDOG 93.\u201dGoing with the theme, I have set this up, with a vintage nut riser, to be played lap style like a Hawaiian guitar.Without the nut extender the relatively high action measures 1/16\u201d at first fret, 2/16\u201d at seventh fret and 3/16\u201d at twelfth fret (see last photos).In all, an enjoyable guitar - both visually and sonically - that is a playable work of art.Comes with inexpensive chipboard case.Local pick up only; CASH ONLY."
