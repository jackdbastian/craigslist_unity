Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

The onboard LR Baggs Elements VTC sounds excellent.  Playability of this guitar is outstanding. The string action at the 12th fret is 2.48mm. The guitar weighs just 3.61 pounds. The neck thickness measures 0.848 at the 1st fret and 0.886 at the 9th fret.The top and back seams had previously separated so the seams have been reglued. The repair is not the prettiest, but it's very stable. There's a couple tiny dings and chips around the seams. Other than that there is only very light handling wear throughout, otherwise in near-mint condition. The frets have been polished to a bright shine and there is no visible fretwear. The neck is perfectly straight and the truss rod works. The tuners work perfectly. All electronics work with zero issues.Includes the original hardshell case and all original accessories. The case is in excellent condition with only minor wear on the exterior from storage. Includes the original Certificate of Authenticity COA.Guild M-20E 6-string Acoustic-electric Guitar at a Glance:    Straightforward mahogany construction    Comfortable concert body    LR Baggs VTC electronicsStraightforward mahogany constructionThe M-20E's neck, top, back, and sides are constructed entirely from solid mahogany. This tonewood was chosen for its centered tone that exudes warmth without ever becoming muddy, and clarity that never sounds shrill. The rosewood fretboard and bridge further help to enhance the guitar's harmonic overtones, and the M-20E's appearance is as warm and inviting as its tone. Minimal aesthetic appointments give the instrument a vintage look that works as beautifully onstage as it does around a campfire.Comfortable concert bodySmaller-bodied acoustic guitars such as this Guild M-20E have been a popular option among players since the dawn of the instrument. This concert-style body in particular is a favorite for its midrange-focused tone that helps each note come through loud and clear. This makes the M-20E a wonderful option for fingerstyle players and flatpickers alike. And the guitar's smaller dimensions are very comfortable for the performing guitarist that needs to have the M-20E slung over a shoulder all night long.LR Baggs VTC electronicsGuild's M-20E 6-string acoustic-electric guitar was built for when you need to perform. The guitar boasts the LR Baggs Element VTC electronics package. This under-saddle pickup system is incredibly popular for the way it senses the movements of your M-20E's mahogany top instead of direct string movement. This helps avoid the sharp-sounding quack that has been associated with the piezo under-saddle design. You'll enjoy a much more natural acoustic-type tone with the Element VTC. And its soundhole-mounted electronics are very low-profile and discreet.Guild M-20E 6-string Acoustic-electric Guitar Features:    6-string acoustic-electric guitar built to vintage Guild specs    All-mahogany construction offers a warm, balanced tone    Thin satin finish lets the wood vibrate freely    Minimal aesthetic appointments offer a vintage appearance    Concert body style is comfortable and even sounding    LR Baggs electronics sound warm and naturalTech Specs    String Type: Steel    Number of Strings: 6    Body Shape: Concert    Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed    Color: Natural    Finish: Satin Nitrocellulose Lacquer    Top Wood: Solid Mahogany    Back & Sides Wood: Solid Mahogany    Body Bracing: X-Scalloped    Neck Wood: Mahogany    Neck Shape: C shape    Radius: 12    Fingerboard Material: Rosewood    Fingerboard Inlay: Pearloid dots    Number of Frets: 20    Scale Length: 24.75    Tuning Machines: Vintage style open-gear, 20:1 ratio    Bridge Material: Rosewood    Nut/Saddle Material: Bone/Bone    Nut Width: 1.75    Electronics: LR Baggs Element VTC pickup system    Strings: Light Gauge    Case Included: Hardshell case    Body Length: 18    Body Width: 13.75 lower bout, 10 upper bout    Body Depth: 4.12 lower, 3.25 upper    Overall Length: 39    Manufacturer Part Number: 385-1204-821 Price is firm.

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
