Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

They are just a couple of years old, sealed, and thus as good as new.These are no longer made so are hard to find. Martin was using Cleartone for the coating at this point, but since then they have formulated their own in-house coating which they now call Lifespan 2.0. I have not tried those strings so do not know how they compare. Perhaps because no licensing fees are involved, they are a bit cheaper.These sold for $19 each and sets of 3 would typically go for over $40. I scoured a site named after a famous Brasilian river to get an idea of what a fair price would be. The posted price is for three sets as it is an unopened box."

Stamped on the top of the headstock is \u201cFATDOG 93.\u201dGoing with the theme, I have set this up, with a vintage nut riser, to be played lap style like a Hawaiian guitar.Without the nut extender the relatively high action measures 1/16\u201d at first fret, 2/16\u201d at seventh fret and 3/16\u201d at twelfth fret (see last photos).In all, an enjoyable guitar - both visually and sonically - that is a playable work of art.NEW gig bag included (not shown).Local pick up only; CASH ONLY."
