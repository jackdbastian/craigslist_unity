                "description": "2006 Toyota Prius. Very low mileage and top of the line Package 6 with a clean title and the hybrid battery has been replaced. The car was T-boned on the drivers side (mostly fixed) and I'm helping my neighbor sell it. Please read the WHOLE ad. It was T-boned about 2 weeks ago with a hit and runs driver (please see pictures) mostly affecting the drivers side 2 doors. I was able to locate the exact same color doors and drove to Rancho Cordova yesterday to purchase them and get them installed. They only spent 15 minutes installing them and $900 later, it looks better but the damage to the body/frame was more significant than I/we thought. This is a body man special. You can see from the pictures that the base of the door frame was pushed in about 2 inches and will need to be pulled out/pushed down in order for the door(s) to line up perfectly. The front door closes flush but the rear door only closes to the first click and I don't want to push too hard on it. This would be great for someone handy or perfect for a body shop to quite easily fix. Aside from what was stated above, the paint is starting to fade from the sun on the front hood. That's it! Now for the good stuff.. Runs absolutely perfectClean title130,904 original milesThe hybrid battery was replaced on January 28th, 2019 at a mileage of 85,858. (Yes, I have documentation)Smog passed and completed for the sale 05/02/2021Current registrationTop of the line Package 6. Every option offered Leather (has a rip or two on the drivers seat but still in good shape)New tiresNavigationBack up cameraPower windowsPower door locksPower mirrorsCruise controlKeyless entryCold A/CFront, side and rear curtain airbagsHID headlampsJBL sound systemAUX cordBluetoothCatalytic converter anti theft cat shield installed Even has parking sensors!Please note that we have misplaced the title and have a duplicate title form which serves the exact same purpose as a physical title. Very simply and straightforward and I will happily accompany you to AAA for the transfer if that's a concern. Full disclosure so there's no surprises. No big deal.This car runs and drives like a dream. Absolutely as straight as an arrow on the freeway. With the replaced hybrid battery and low mileage, she should continue to run well for the years to come. Comes with a full tank of gas!Looking for the right buyer to offer $3500 obo for this little gem. Again, she runs and drives like new but just needs a little love getting the rear door to line up correctly. (Again, I've included both before and after pictures of how it looked after the accident and how it looks now that it's been mostly fixed. The new doors are installed)Please e-mail and include your phone number. Please put I read the whole ad in the subject heading. Thank you."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
