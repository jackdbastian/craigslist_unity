                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "I am selling my 60W Bogner Shiva Guitar Head Amp with EL34 tubes, Dual Spring Reverb 2 Channels. This is a 60W Head with Footswitch that controls overdrive, reverb and second channel.The amp is in great condition, no rips in tolex, light use touring and studio work.The cleanest tone ever. I went with a combo for ease of touring/shows so selling this head, no cab.Here's some info on the head:The classic modded-Marshall tone. Bogner is well-known for their top-quality tone. The Shiva is infamous for great clean tone plus hot-rodded rock tones, and this amp delivers. At 80W, it is suitable for any size club, and the Master volume makes it home-friendly as well.This amp is recently tubed and biased. It is the most recent circuit (11 knob, NOT 20th anniversary). This gives excellent flexibility in using the boost, especially for channel 2.Clean, clear tone, cuts through ANY mix. The EL34 power section is the right level of power and character for the famous musical power tube breakup, and the tone is flexible enough for any style of music.This amp is in excellent physical condition.Switchable speaker impedance control makes it compatible with 4, 8 and 16 Ohms. It will drive a small 1x12 or a full 4x12 stack.This amp has reverb and a separate reverb level control for each channel. Reverb is also switchable.There is an effects loop that allows for four-cable connection to effects for best tone.--Firm on price, pickup in San Anselmo studio.Don"

                "description": "Fully discrete these are famous for their thick and rich tone... great as mic preamps or as a summing unit or as an analog mixer. You just can't get a transformer loaded discrete channel with preamp, line amp, sends and EQ for anywhere near this price.Comes with enough new parts to recap a few channels and you can add more channel strips later if you need more.... they come up on ebay every few weeks or so.The 6 individual strips alone often sell for about 125-150 each plus tax and shipping.  The GA80080 Tamura Output Transformers sell for about 60-65 each."
