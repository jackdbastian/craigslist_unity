Car already has new the steel gear box which replaced by dealer under TSB 08-003-21,  huge improvement on handling.  I purchased Mopar Max Care warranty plan,  it will last until 5/5/2025 or 60,000 miles.  That\u2019s another four years bumper to bumper warranty,  it should be transferable.   The windshield is crack now but I will have it fix before the sale.  Kbb private party average price is $48000 without all the upgrade.  With the upgrade it should be priced $59000 without the Mopar max care.   What I am asking is very reasonable.  Please contact me only when you are ready to buy.  I am not rushing to sell it.

These were only made for a short time: 1981 - 1983It was serviced by Pete Cage last year, he replaced the hard-wired speaker cable with a 'proper' speaker out  which looks factory. Has the original vinyl Cover and original speaker. There are no rips, stains, tears.  The preamp tubes are GE 12ax7a's.  Pete said the power tubes are Sylvania 6VGT's with the Fender Logo.  When I had it serviced he put everything he replaced in a baggie and gave it back to me.  Once I got it back from him it sounded better than ever - it's a very complex clean tone with no noise or hash.Such a great clean tone at comfortable home volumes and it will also get loud. Doesn't break up much beyond crunch with my Les Paul unless you pull the mid boost.$70 - Eminence GA10-SC64 10 20-Watt 8 Ohm Replacement Speaker          This speaker is in pristine condition. It was installed for a couple of weeks and carefully taken out          (stored in a box). No issues of any kind."

HERE IS A REVIEW I just received: I have that same model guitar , I have been playing for a very long time and I absolutely love the guitar .I have very fine Martin guitars that are prewar vintage and I find myself reaching for my X-commie most of the time . I perform on stage with my X-commie and it sounds so very , very good . Good luck on your sale I hope someone realizes what a fine guitar it actually is.   Good Luck on your sale .     Chuck  It has a great sound really good action and a nice neck, it looks like the back and sides are maple in any case it has a pretty robust sound for a maple back and sides guitar it's not overly bright and it has a really good bass in addition to a really good treble. Here is part of a Harmony Central (I googled Montana MT-204) review, which I agree completely with:This guitar has incredible sound qualities, from high clear bell like tones to low loud bass and good mid range. i believe it would work well for most any style of music this guitar really projects. everyone who has ever played it has said basically the same thing with a look of surprise, This guitar has great tone! the surprise comes from the fact that nothing about the guitars appearance would suggest that it was anything special.Could DELIVER to greater Rohnert Park Area."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.
