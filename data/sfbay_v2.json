In 1990 I attended a church charity event in San Bruno, Ca and these gloves were one of the bidding items. There was a bidding war with about 6 of us, however the reserve was not met and these gloves were not sold. They were held for the next years charity event. In 1991 I again attended this event.  These gloves were once again on the block. There was another bidding war with approx. 6-10 others. I won the bid and my cost was $425.00, however that was only for charity. The entire time they have been in a vented box, climate house and never put on. Both are in pristine, brand new unblemished condition. At the time of win/sale (1991) I was given a professional document of authenticity from the church with dates, serial number etc. At one point I put it in our safety deposit box, then there was a move to another bank box. At this point we can't find the document in our files. I have contacted the church. It's been 30 years and this church no longer puts on these sport type of charitable events. We wrote to the George Foreman's Offical web site. We are waiting for a response back. I have no idea what these are worth, however a George Foreman fan should have them.... $75.00........Thank you"

                "description": "Selling my \u201972 Twin Reverb as I am not doing as much gigging and want to get something smaller to play at home.Vintage Fender Twin Reverb\u2019s arguably have the best clean tone out there, and this amp is no exception. It also takes pedal well so regardless of the type of music you play, it sounds amazing.Along with amazing tone, this thing gets LOUD so you will have no problem with volume while playing with a full band in practice or while gigging. No need to mic it up. It also comes with tilt back legs so you can position the amp at a 45 degree angle (see 2nd image).While the amp is heavy, it comes with wheels, a large handle and a cover so it can be safely moved by one person.In terms of the electronics, the amp is in great condition. I recently brought it to a tech and had all of the internal electronics cleaned and tested. They were actually shocked to find that the amp still has all original parts and that they are in such good condition as this is rare and highly sought after nowadays. The amp comes with 2 12\u201d Utah speakers (also original) which sound great and have plenty of life left. I also have the original foot switch and a cover.While I do have the original RCA tubes, I plan to keep them to use in a future amp since they are extremely rare. I replaced all of the tubes with brand new, more powerful ones and had the amp rebiased accordingly. Cosmetically, since the amp is vintage, it has some scuffs and visible wear but nothing major. The amp is currently at a practice space, so if you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d be happy to let you try it out. $900 OBO"

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Since you see this ad now, it means that Deep Mind 12 is STILL AVAILABLE.Behringer's famous first analog synth, Deep Mind 12. True analog, 12-voice poly, 4x effects engines, 8x modulation matrix, 1024 patches onboard. Commonly known as Juno on steroids, the modern incarnation of Juno-106 (for the look and bunch of buttons and sliders), it's actually closer to more advanced Juno-60 and JX series. Think JX-10 with all these Juno sliders and  a PG-800 programmer built in. I had and have most of classic analog polysynths, the last one was JX-10 with Vecoven upgrade (cost me over $1300), but even that one doesn't come close to DM12 in sound, features and ease of use. Nothing can beat the feeling of just grabbing a slider and adjusting the value right away, instead of recalling parameter first, then adjusting it, then recalling another, like on JX. You can even play with two or more sliders at once, like cutoff and resonance. There's no way you can do it on any JX.12-voice polyphony does make the difference, you'll never have cut notes as it happens with 6-voice synths like Juno, JX-8P or Polysix.DM12 is analog fanatics' heaven: everything you wished an old Juno or JX had is here, already implemented. IMHO it's the dream analog polysynth: plenty of sliders on surface for instant tweaking like on Junos and Jupiters, and a large graphic display for in-depth editing (no external programmer or software editors are needed). DM12 has a lot more editable parameters than surface allows, so combination of physical sliders for most critical parameters and on-screen menus for everything else is the best, like for effects parameters (it has no less than 4 separate effects engines made by TC Electronics, makers of legendary studio rack effect units like 2290, M-One and D-Two). Plus, an insane 1024 memories onboard (instead 32 to128 on classics) make it quite usable even for live performances. I'd take it over Nord Lead, Novation Peak or Prophet-6 any day!DM12 are becoming rare, since they are no longer produced, and Behringer now is focusing on producing the exact copies of the classic synthesizers. DM12 is an original design, and while it has a lot of layout and sonic similarities with Junos, it's far more advanced and superior to all of them, in a small package with solid all-metal design.  Watch videos for sound samples, more detailed overview of features and comparisons to classic synths.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynm44MeqPfk&feature=emb_logoVery detailed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8B6HJ2chQThis DM12 is in great shape, practically new, not even a single scratch anywhere. Selling only because I mostly play live and need more universal synth like Kronos or Montage. My price is fair: they are no longer produced and becoming rare (especially in new condition like mine). Be way of online buys: some sellers won't tell you everything, and in case of problems you'll be paying for return shipment anyway, IF seller accepts returns (most don't).Low-ball offers: No reply means that your offer went straight to trash. I don't need to know how much they are on eBay, or that somebody is selling it for less or is willing to give it to you for free: if he does, go and get that one.Thanks for looking!"
