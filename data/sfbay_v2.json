However, selling this in an AS IS condition, as there are a few things that need some work:*Needs either a new catalytic converter or O2 sensor before it would pass another smog test (but current one valid until Sept)*Front bumper needs new screws to attach it to carriage (currently using some duct tape, functional but not pretty)*Tear on leather of Driver's seat*Sun roof doesn't openiVIN Report Summary:This vehicle's market value is $6,544.This vehicle is estimated to have 168,000 miles on the odometer.Projected depreciation: $976 in 5 years."

                "description": "Solid state version of a 4210 combo.  Clean and dirty channel.  Master reverb and Volume.  Replaced the filter caps; sprayed the pots; touched up solder points. Really does get that '80's Marshall crunch, even at low volume but also loud enough for gigging at moderate volumes.  All stock except for a 4 Ohm Fender Eminence replacing the original Celestion G12-70. It's a good fit tone wise.  Good cosmetics. Includes original REAN two-button FS and TRS cable.Without footswitch connected, both channels are active so you can mix them together.Plenty of demos, reviews and comps online. Send a phone number if you want to hear back. Not looking for trades."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
