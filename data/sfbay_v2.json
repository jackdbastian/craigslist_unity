This is a wedding size 10, which is US Street size 6-8. Originally paid $2100 for this gown, and found it to be extremely comfortable and to photograph beautifully! The dress will come in a wedding garment bag, and I'm happy to include BHLDN French Market hanger shown in photos as well as miscl accessories if interested.Condition: The dress is a little dirty along very bottom edge of the dress (normal dance floor dirt) that will come out with standard wedding dress cleaning - Unfortunately the pandemic impacted plans to dry clean the dress, but the price has been heavily discounted to account for dry cleaning need. Attached are some photos of a Day 2 session - the last photo is unedited and shows the light staining on the train. AlterationsThe train was shortened to be chapel length (chapel train takes longer to ship so I altered instead), and 2/3 under-layers were removed to reduce weight of dress while still maintaining ballgown shape. A pearl belt was sewn on but can be removed. The dress is also bustled.You can see the dress on the designer's website here: https://www.justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/collection/wedding-dresses/8937/"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
