No discoloration or issues on the bottom. Bought in June 2018. Size 4. I think that means street size 6. Has been altered, with added cups so there's no need for a bra. Loops and a central button were added for a bustle. One of the three loops for the bustle ripped, but the rip is smaller than a quarter size as seen in photo. Could probably get it fixed for fairly cheap. You can't see it with the flow of the dress. The length was altered for 5'9 - ish. I'm 5'6 and wore 3 inch heels. The Willowby 58420 Allira wedding dress has a strapless A-line silhouette with a sweetheart neckline, corset bodice, semi-open curved back and court train. This full-length gown is tailored in soft poly chiffon over a knit lining, enriched with laser cut lace coating the fitted bodice.Serious inquiries only."

This JC-77 is the smaller sibling of the legendary JC-120 featuring 80 watts of power, two 10\u2033 speakers, true stereo chorus and real spring reverb. All original and in very good shape with some minor wear. These amps sound awesome for loud, clean guitar, are perfect for pedals and even sound great with synths and keys. ***The onboard chorus effect has that iconic, nostalgic \u201980s tone and is \u201crate\u201d and \u201cdepth\u201d adjustable on the JC- A great amp with an unmistakable sound! I've used it for electric guitar, as well as acoustic and keyboards! ***Everything is in functional (distortion, EQ, reverb, both chorus settings) and this particular amp has way less hiss that is common to most Jazz Choruses. The JC-77 is rarer and in fewer stock than the JC-120, and the pricing reflects this. Check eBay or reverb regarding price. (currently at $749).

The A channel provides an amazing clean tone with volume, treble, and bass controls.  The B channel provides dirty tone to achieve sounds ranging from bluesy crunch to full tilt hard rock. Includes gain, treble, mid, base, and volume controls. Both channels have high quality reverb with per-channel controls.  The amp includes an effects loop with cable (included) that allows you to insert effects between the preamp and the poweramp.  There is a channel selector, standby switch, and a footswitch jack. It\u2019s in combo amp format with a Crate Vintage Series 8 ohm, 12\u201d speaker.  Made in the U.S.A.  This amp sounds great at low volume as a practice amp, but it is also loud enough to play with a drummer in small to medium sized venues.This amp sits in a custom built lacquered tweed cabinet with thatched grille cloth.  The original cabinet was fully enclosed and tended to get extremely hot. This new cabinet orients the amp with the tubes pointing downward and has an open back which provides plenty of ventilation and solves the excessive heat issue."

                "description": "This is a very nice, handmade Mountain Dulcimer in the Hourglass shape made from Folkcraft Instruments. This instrument was handmade in Winsted, Connecticut by legendary dulcimer maker (according to Hayley Speakman of Folkcraft Instruments), either the famous David Marks in their shop in Winsted, CT sometime around 1989.  On the inside is HC? with 486 -H an hourglass shape, and C which means it is solid cherry and , and something else ?). On his nicer instruments, David Marks usually included the 6.5 fret and the 13.5 fret so that is an additional clue as to it's maker. It is entirely solid cherry wood and has a 27 scale. This instrument is in amazing condition and cost at least $800 - 1000 in 1989.  I think $360 right now, make me an offer. You are invited out to Walnut Creek to check it out. Soft case and a set of strings included. Call, text, or email if interested."
