Condition is great.Engineered for one of the greatest players of all time, the Wilson Pro Staff RF97 Autograph 2018 plays just like the previous two versions, but has been dressed up with a tuxedo cosmetic. Our team decided this would be the perfect opportunity to expand the playtest to Europe and Australia to get a global perspective on this surgical weapon. The Pro Staff RF97 Autograph impressed our playtesters at the baseline with its plow through, stability, feel and control. From all corners of the world, our playtesters raved about this racquet's stability at the net, and several players called it one of the best volleying racquets on the market. Although serves and returns proved more demanding for some, our testers loved what this racquet had to offer once they got used to its heavier feel. For this playtest our team strung the racquet with Federer's favorite string, Wilson's Champion's Choice, as well as a full bed of poly. By the end of this playtest everyone was happy to report that this racquet remains one the best options available for advanced, big-swinging players.https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/reviews/PRF97A/PRF97AReview.htmlHead Size: 97 sq. in MPLength: 27 inchesWeight: Strung \u2014 12.6 oz / 357 g Tension: 50-60 PoundsBalance: 9 Pts Head LightBeam Width: 21.5 / 21.5 / 21.5 mmComposition: Graphite braided with aramidFlex: 68Grip Type: Babolat Syntec ProString Pattern: 16 Mains / 19 CrossesTwo PieceNo Shared HolesSwing Weight: 335"

It has a rebuilt engine that was swapped with a B20, still has the VTEC heads, manual transmission, and is a blast to drive. It runs great and I would not think twice to take this car on a long road trip. It has aftermarket suspension and it handles better than a 2008 m3. Shoot me an offer. I have the original seats as well that I can include if you want them as well. The car has a real carbon fiber hood, I put a wrap on it to protect it. It sounds awesome, real throaty for a 4cil, and feels like I'm driving in the original Fast & Furious movie.

Price: $1200 for the head,  $600 for the speaker. Excellent condition. The Fender 100T is powerful and loud, while being very sensitive to the dynamics of the player\u2019s touch. It responds beautifully across the frequency spectrum with a sparkling, harmonically rich tone at low and moderate volumes. At louder volumes it thickens with a sweet distortion that only seems to get creamier the more it\u2019s cranked. It is not just a bass amp but is simply amazing with even my miked acoustic guitar. It has 3 power choices: 100, 25, and 25 watt silent mode. This rarely mentioned feature allows you to record without sound from the speakers but with a recordable full featured sound - after preamp and amp adjustments. Located in Santa Rosa for inspection and pick-up. No shipping/delivery available."

This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades.
