I believe the letter B is the size. The gloves are approximately 10 long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening. They are in very excellent cosmetic condition with just a few small blemishes as shown.------Please call/text   or email anytime. Pickup in Rohnert Park.Cash or Venmo accepted.

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades.

If you are serious about owning a vintage Hammond, it may be worth the trip for this one.The D-152 is electrically the same as a Hammond B-3.  The difference is that the D-100 series have a built-in amplifier, speakers, and reverb. \u00a0There are adapters available to hook it up to a Leslie, or you could make your own connections.It has the famous Hammond B-3 percussion, the same slide bars, same keyboard, the same pre-sets.Mine has a serial number of 2427, probably manufactured in 1967-1968. \u00a0Originally sold in Eureka, CA.It is over 50 years old, and everything functions. Could use cleaning and up-dating, of course. \u00a0The B-3 percussion sounds great. \u00a0Has a small amount of hum at the loud settings, possibly a pre-amp tube.Has two 12 speakers and two 8 speakers.It is missing the bass pedals. \u00a0The cabinet is in decent condition for its age -- still has a good polish, but does have a few scrapes on the corners.Includes a new unopened bottle of Hammond oil. \u00a0The instructions for modifying the presets are inside, as well as the original cloth bag of extra preset screws. \u00a0(See photos)This would be ideal for someone who wants to make a cut-down portable Hammond B3.Any questions please write. \u00a0Cash, no trades. In Arcata. \u00a0------------------------------------------------Here are some Internet links and info:http://www.tonewheelgeneral.com/agelist/agelist.php \u00a0https://ethw.org/Hammond_B3_Organ \u00a0The B3, C3, A100, A105, RT-3, and D-152 all had the same electronics that produced the famed B-3 sound.The same vibrato, chorus, and 2nd & 3rd harmonic percussion.Model B3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1975)Model B2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from December 1949 through December 1954)Model C3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1975)Model A100 Series \u00a0 (Manufactured from ~1959 through 1965)Note: \u00a0 Model A105 continued to be manufactured until January/February 1975.Model RT3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1974)Model D100 series \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from July 1963 through September 1969)The Cadillac of Hammonds.
