This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch.

Furthermore I can load this with a UK made V30 or the Creamback that came with it. The V30 is gonna be more focused with a clearer crunch, more modern, serious gains. The G12H-75 Creamback is gonna be a little more smoother/darker, nice for a more vintage vibe. Your choice.Small hairline crack near power port is the only notable, no other issues. Super clean and sounds amazing. Original box from Wildwood Guitars if you want it.This this is a Marshall lovers dream. Channel 1 is the best vintage Plexi tone around, hands down. Hendrix to Malcom Young here. Channel 2 is everything from low gain modern crunch to saturated modern gains with just enough compression. Should mention this amp loves pedal too, takes fuzz, drives, effects perfectly. Friedman makes one of the quietest, usable effect loops around for your Delays, Reverbs etc.Check what used prices are on these. Lotsa clips on YouTube. I believe this is Dave's all around best amp. Channel 1's lower gain Plexi tone is pure gold and where I lived. I've owned easily over a dozen Marshall type circuit amps, this is at the top. Of course channel 2 is all about Friedman's famous high gain BBE mod/model and this is what put him on the map so if your looking for EVH to George Lynch to GnR's or even drop D sludge, look no further.No trades, weird inquiries'. Come with cash, leave with a lifetime amp.Fender Bogner Ampeg Diezel Carr Peavey Dr Z Two Rock VHT Engl Vox Budda Suhr Mesa Egnator PRS Orange Matchless Blackstar Line 6 Kemper Yamaha Boss"

This would also be a great investment unlike a new sax that would depreciate in value.This sax plays nice and has that tone the Mark VI is famous for. Original finish but does show slight wear, but very nice for it\u2019s age. No dents & the serial numbers do match, and the original case is in very good condition. Please email with any questions."
