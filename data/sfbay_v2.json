These were $2850 new! Includes solid state and tube rectifier.Killer amp! Specs and info belowVersatile Vintage-style Amp HeadThe Bogner Telos all-tube guitar amplifier head is a powerful single-channel design that can handle all of your rock and blues tonal needs. If you desire the sound of a great, cranked vintage amplifier that responds beautifully to your playing, the Telos is it. A 6-position Schizo switch defines the character of the amp's EQ. Two footswitchable master volumes make dynamic changes fast and effortless. And you can even choose between a tube and solid-state rectifier to nail the feel you desire. For a single-channel amp, the Bogner Telos is one of the more versatile options out there.Bogner Telos 40-watt Tube Guitar Amplifier Head at a Glance:Wide range of blues and rock tonesGreat tone at any volumeAdaptable to your playing styleWide range of blues and rock tonesOnboard the Bogner Telos, you'll find boutique electric guitar tones that run the gamut from smoky blues grind to modified high-gain rock. Like all Bogner tube amplifiers, the Telos is extremely touch sensitive, allowing you to dictate your level of gain with your guitar's volume knob and your playing dynamics. Though the Telos boasts only a single channel, its 6-position Schizo switch allows you to voice the amp to the rest of your rig. And the amplifier's 6L6 power section delivers warm lows, a clear and present top end, and enough punch to keep up with any band.Great tone at any volumeThough the Telos is capable of pushing a very loud 40 watts, it has been carefully crafted to give you the same tube tones at bedroom levels as it does at arena volume. You'll fall in love with the two footswitchable master volumes. They are incredibly transparent, and with a tap of your toe, you'll be able to boost above the band and fall perfectly back into the mix when desired. And the Telos' 40- and 20-watt settings help you find the perfect amount of headroom for your music and style. Sweetwater players know that dynamics are everything. And the Telos has you covered.Adaptable to your playing styleThe Bogner Telos all-tube guitar amplifier head is packed with features that ensure any blues and rock guitar players can find their ideal tones and functionality onboard. You'll find a switch for choosing between either a tube or a solid-state rectifier. This is where you'll determine if the amp responds with vintage sponginess or the immediate, punchy attack of many modern amps. The tube-buffered effects loop gives your time-based effects a clear and consistent signal. And the 3-button footswitch controls the dual master volumes, the effects loop, and an onboard gain boost.Bogner Telos 40-watt Tube Guitar Amplifier Head Features:40-watt, single-channel tube amp head for rock and bluesEngineered to sound great, even at bedroom levelsCan be run at 40 and 20 watts6-position Schizo switch changes the amp's characterTube and solid-state rectifiers offer differing responseTube-buffered effects loopDual master volumes for fast dynamic changes3-button footswitch selects between 2 master volumes, a gain boost, and the effects loopThe Bogner Telos is an amazingly versatile single-channel amp head."
