Next 3 pics are photos of the dress on me. Spent a ton on the dress, nothing on the photographer. Big mistake!Since it is a corset back, it's difficult to get the exact measurements of the dress - it has an inch or so give in either direction.It has a thread to mark where the dress can be tied up in the back when you don't want a train anymore.It was only worn once, the day of my wedding. I absolutely loved the dress, and should have gotten more pictures the day-of of the back of the dress!AlterationsThe dress was taken in to fit me better. The measurements given above are the measurements of the dress currently, not pre-alteration."

It pumps 50 watts through a single 12 speaker, creating a muscular low end perfect for club gigs and recording sessions.

I hear they're plenty loud at 15 watts and one efficient 12 speaker, but because I've only played it at home I've never turned it up over 4.  Has both master and volume controls so you can add some dirt at lower volumes.   Great pedal platform as it has really nice clean tones.  Just a great amp overall.

If you can plug it in to make music , they make    The Aerophone is their step into the wind controller market and of course they killed it .It may look like a space craft but it is very well thought out as far as the function and ergonomics .Of course it has the famous  Roland sounds .    If you are a woodwind player and you need a brass or string layer on recording , no need to hire anyone else . You can do it.    It has a built in speaker and can run on batteries so you can play it anywhere !I can be upgraded via your computer and has been just graded to the latest version    If you are non wind player the Aerophone has a very short learning curve since no embouchure is needed , just blow and wiggle your fingers   This one is in a rare  grey color . Most are whiteIncluded is the Aerophone  , case , all the original paperwork , AC power supply . rechargeable batteries and an EXTRA  mouthpiece  ( $60 value ) that is not included for the factory . It is in asnew condition    I have played and owned EVERY  wind concroller from the original AKAI  EWI up to the Yamaha  WX-5 and I feel this one it the best so farSave over  $200 off the new pricesee demo  at   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqhHVfNQmHg             also  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUr0YmbIRhk"

                "description": "I have a brand new Crescendo full-size intermediate/advanced hand-crafted Violin. Since I play anything with strings, I have other violins, guitars, mandolins, etc., etc., ~ this one I bought as a collectors item and I spent a pretty penny on her. She is in mint condition. I also have multiple chin rests, shoulder rests (all high-dollar) I also have 6 bows, from white horsehair, to blackhair, and many others. The one pictured here is a genuine Jon Krausche. I also paid a pretty penny (or two) for this rare wooden bow. I believe that the wood (Pernambuco with Mongolian Horse Hair) is no longer legal to manufacture. This information came through a famous teacher in the SF area. I have ALL of the accessories (and even more) a Violinist might want. I will negotiate things like the limited edition of the Devils Violinist DVD featuring David Garrett as Paginini (life story) ~ I have multiple Rosins, dark, light and everything in between including New Strings ($$) ~ I bought this Violin to hang on to as an investment, but my guitar playing has taken over once again and I just can't stand to see my baby sit and collect dust. The case is insane. It has zippers, locks, clamps, clips, multiple compartments throughout ($$$) .. there is nothing crappy or cheap about this puppy. I'm asking a 'low-ball' price for the Violin. Talk to me and we will negotiate all of the other accessories (I even have two electric pickups that attach if needed)... I can't think of anything else. Just look at the photos closely. If you play, you will know what you are seeing in the pile of accessories, which are also brand new. I learned what I wanted to with my Carbon Fiber Violin and I just fell back to the Guitar (going on 50 years of playing now) ~ you WILL have to meet me in downtown Sonora. I will come of the Mountain to meet you. In speaking with me you will decide. If you make the trip (about 2 hours from SF) .. you will purchase her and likely many accessories. I've kept the price down so that you can afford the accessories YOU need for YOUR body. I paid aprox $1000.00 for the Violin. All the accessories are high-quality. No cheap junk. The bows are all rare woods. Multiple (4) holders inside case, tube, sheet music pouches and thermometer. Velour cover, etc... it's everything you need for intermediate players. This is not for a beginner, unless you want to just purchase something NICE right off the bat and spare the misery of a junker. Call me. Thanks!"
