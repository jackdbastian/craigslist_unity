It has a rebuilt engine that was swapped with a B20, still has the VTEC heads, manual transmission, and is a blast to drive. It runs great and I would not think twice to take this car on a long road trip. It has aftermarket suspension and it handles better than a 2008 m3. Shoot me an offer. I have the original seats as well that I can include if you want them as well. The car has a real carbon fiber hood, I put a wrap on it to protect it. It sounds awesome, real throaty for a 4cil, and feels like I'm driving in the original Fast & Furious movie.

                "description": "Stop paying outrageous gas prices, and buy this lovely 4-door electric car for a bargain! Use the HOV lane by yourself until 1/1/2023! No more oil changes, smog checks, belt replacements, or engine problems! The only fluid is the windshield fluid!This is the Spark's highest trim level, with leatherette upholstery, heated seats, and DC FAST CHARGING (a CCS port). That allows you to charge up at stations all over your town and everywhere else in 15-20 minutes, usually for a small fee. Every couple months, I was very glad to have that. I had emergency tow coverage on my auto insurance, but never used it. Check Plugshare.com for your nearby CCS fast charging locations.This was my first electric vehicle, I was the second owner. I love it very much, but we are moving overseas for a year and I don't want it to get ruined sitting. I have been a clean vehicles aficionado for almost 15 years, and I can answer any questions you have about using this or other electric cars.When full, it will tell you it has 60 miles of range, but that's its best guess based on my driving, because almost every mile I drove was on the freeway at freeway speeds. If you do any city driving or stop-and-go traffic, that will go way up, to about 80 miles. (On one trip, I drove from Prunedale to Watsonville to the San Jose Airport to Gilroy on one charge, 94.5 miles; but that will take some practice at steady driving. The cruise control will help you with that.) As you can see in the dash photo, I've gotten 4.1 miles per kWh for the last 13,000 miles I've driven, which is extremely efficient, even among EVs. Any other 4-door EV, like a Tesla or Bolt, will use more electricity per mile and cost more to charge up. Your car, at 15 miles per gallon of $4.25 gas, costs 28 cents/mile to drive. On my PG&E EV-B plan, charging overnight, this Spark costs about 7 cents/mile. If you don't live out in the country like I do, you will be more efficient, and it may be more like 5 cents/mile. I drove it to work every day and charged it for free on my employer's Level-2 charger, which could charge it from empty to full in about 5 hours. You may get free Level-2 charging at your work, hotels, malls, state parks, and other places that want to encourage you to visit.The battery is warrantied for 10 years/150k miles: https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/california-vehicle-and-emissions-warranty-periodsI cancelled the XM Radio subscription for it about three months ago, but it hasn't stopped for some reason, so... enjoy! The console infotainment display is a nice touchscreen. You can connect your phone to it easily by Bluetooth, by USB cable, or by auxiliary cord, and listen to podcasts or Spotify or whatever you've got. If you're connected by Bluetooth, you can also send and receive calls hands free through the stereo. If you pay for OnStar (I didn't), that gets you: directions (i.e. to the nearest charger/pizza/etc.), in-car Wi Fi, and the ability to monitor everything about the car (i.e. charge state, maybe location?) through the Chevy app on your phone.The glove box is the only interior space that closes, but it has lots of little trays and cup holders between front/rear seats, in the doors and door handles, and on the dash. The interior is gray with blue accents all over, it's very pretty. The only notable flaw is on the left side of the driver's seat, where the surface upholstery has been damaged. It does not penetrate the fabric, only the leatherette surface. I don't know whether that's from the sun or something in my back pocket, but a seat cover could cover that if that's important to you. My decals on the back are objectively awesome, but I will remove them if you want me to. I will deliver to any town in the Bay Area, Sacramento area, or of course on the Central Coast where I live. I can meet you at a quickcharge station and will pay for the final fill up. Elsewhere in the US/World, I will cooperate with whatever shipping entity you hire. \u2022 Clear title in hand!\u2022 DC fast charge port (most Sparks did not come with this option)\u2022 Regenerative braking, low/high mode\u2022 Sport mode, for high performance\u2022 XM radio capable (and still going for now)\u2022 Hands-free phone calls through the stereo\u2022 10 air bags!\u2022 Rear seat folds down for extra cargo space, one half or both sides\u2022 Heated seats in front (very energy-efficient way to warm up)\u2022 Steering wheel controls for cruise control, stereo\u2022 Cold A/C, fast Heater/defrost\u2022 Dashboard tire pressure display\u2022 Good tire tread remaining\u2022 Liquid-cooled batteries!\u2022 Rear windshield wiper\u2022 Keyless entry, remote climate control\u2022 OnStar capable\u2022 Child carseat anchor points behind rear seats\u2022 Level-1 charger cable under the trunk, if you need it\u2022 Battery still under warranty!"

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most solid-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Selling a mint-condition MXR CSP102SL Script Dyna Comp Reissue pedal in original box. This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades. Will accept cash, PayPal, or Venmo. Local buyers only. Good luck"
