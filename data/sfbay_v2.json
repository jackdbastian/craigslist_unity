Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "If you\u2019re looking at this you probably know what it is, but I\u2019ll explain anyways! Here\u2019s an excellent condition Polivoks synthesizer, the Soviet minimoog. It is obviously famous for its unique filter, that ranges from smooth and sweet to screaming and powerful really quickly. But this thing isn\u2019t all evil bass and distorted leads! It can get some smooth, really moog/arp like tones! I love it, but I just invested in a modular system and it\u2019s time to prune the collection sadly. It has the midi mod installed, so you can forgo using the notoriously awful keyboard, which I can testify is not good. There are some quirks about this synth that you can look up online, or if you\u2019re interested I\u2019d be happy to show!Moog korg synth analog Roland Juno space echo eurorack Yamaha"

                "description": "Up for sale is a vintage Ampex AG-350 transport with road case plus a extra transport for parts and the manual. This is a two track transport in great condition. It is the same transport used for the highly sought after 1950\u2019s 350 and 351 machines. Only difference is this has more modern 60\u2019s buttons. However, this transport could be used with a set 1950\u2019s 351 electronics since the heads on this are also high impedance and all the connectors and transport are the same. Also included is the very rare and hard to come by road case. It does not have the lid but still very cool and very hard to come by. In addition it has the AG-350 manual. So, you could find AG 350 electronics for pretty cheap and have complete AG-350 or you could use the 50\u2019s 351 electronics and have famous sound. Either are great sounding vintage tape tone. You can\u2019t lose. It\u2019s up to you. I have too much stuff laying around and already have two other tape machines so these are up for grabs. Thanks for looking and reach out with any questions. Cheers and best regards!"
