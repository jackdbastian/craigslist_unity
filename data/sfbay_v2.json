It sparkles when you move and is definitely a statement dress! I am 5'5 and not wearing shoes in these photos to give you an idea. There's also a short train in the back, maybe about a foot long.I bought this dress as a back-up for my wedding, but ended up using my mothers wedding dress instead, and I can no longer return this one. Originally $385, bought 6 months ago. Beautiful A-line gown, with a stunning glitter pattern on the outer fabric and layers of tulle underneath. Straps are adjustable and could be sewn to the perfect length when you get it altered. Could definitely accommodate a larger bust or just have it taken in a bit. It's not a bright white, but just off-white which I love and works the best in photos. I've only tried it on twice indoors, and haven't done any alterations to it. My loss is your gain!"

You just can't get a transformer loaded discrete channel with preamp, line amp, sends and EQ for anywhere near this price.Comes with enough new parts to recap a few channels and you can add more channel strips later if you need more.... they come up on ebay every few weeks or so.The 6 individual strips alone often sell for about 125-150 each plus tax and shipping.  The GA80080 Tamura Output Transformers sell for about 60-65 each."
