Next 3 pics are photos of the dress on me. Spent a ton on the dress, nothing on the photographer. Big mistake!Since it is a corset back, it's difficult to get the exact measurements of the dress - it has an inch or so give in either direction.It has a thread to mark where the dress can be tied up in the back when you don't want a train anymore.It was only worn once, the day of my wedding. I absolutely loved the dress, and should have gotten more pictures the day-of of the back of the dress!AlterationsThe dress was taken in to fit me better. The measurements given above are the measurements of the dress currently, not pre-alteration."

Sounds like a good robust V30. 8 ohm each speaker and a 8 ohm cab. Loud and proud. The speakers alone are worth more than the asking price. $250, ad will be deleted when sold. Include your phone number for a reply. I will call you. No good phone number, no reply. Thanks and stay well."

Original G12H-75 Creamback loaded (I can load this with a UK made V30 If you prefer)Small hairline crack near power port is the only notable, no other issues. Super clean and sounds amazing. Original box from Wildwood Guitars if you want it.This this is a Marshall lovers dream. Channel 1 is the best vintage Plexi tone around, hands down. Hendrix to Malcom Young here. Channel 2 is everything from low gain modern crunch to saturated modern gains with just enough compression. Should mention this amp loves pedal too, takes fuzz, drives, effects perfectly. Friedman makes one of the quietest, usable effect loops around for your Delays, Reverbs etc.Check what used prices are on these. Lotsa clips on YouTube. Channel 1's lower gain Plexi tone is pure gold and where I lived. I've owned easily over a dozen Marshall type circuit amps, this is at the top. Of course channel 2 is all about Friedman's famous high gain BBE mod/model and this is what put him on the map so if your looking for EVH to George Lynch to GnR's or even drop D sludge, look no further.No trades, weird inquiries'.

You just can't get a transformer loaded discrete channel with preamp, line amp, sends and EQ for anywhere near this price.Comes with enough new parts to recap a few channels and you can add more channel strips later if you need more.... they come up on ebay every few weeks or so.The 6 individual strips alone often sell for about 125-150 each plus tax and shipping.  The GA80080 Tamura Output Transformers sell for about 60-65 each."
