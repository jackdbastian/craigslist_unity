                "description": "Selling brand new  Yamaha DGX-500 portable digital grand piano 88 semi-weighted keys. Item has been pulled out from a box to test functionality, works perfect.   Tons of great sounds: pianos, string, organs, flutes, brass etc etc etc. Built in speakers, MIDI, input for headphones. Power supply is included.  price only  $349  in CASH  or PAYPAL . If you see this add it means the piano is availabletel.   If You are not familiar with latest series DGX pianos, please read below:Built by one of the worlds Premier manufactures, Yamaha's DGX500 is the first full size (88 key) portable keyboard to use actual piano keys, and it's the flagship in a series of instruments from Yamaha called Portable Grand. It's packed with functions and features designed specifically for new piano users. A large, piano-shaped button in the center of the front panel calls up the keyboard's best piano sound. A piano accompaniment style is automatically chosen and readied if you want it. Next to the piano button is a metronome-shaped button for, of course, a metronome feature.The DGX505 features an extra-high-quality stereo piano sample, general MIDI (GM) compatibility, and a selection of Yamaha's famous XG Lite voices, all of which work in concert to give you remarkably good sound quality. The quality is enhanced by the keyboard's two-way speakers with bass-enhancing ports.Polyphony is the ability for a keyboard to sound multiple tones simultaneously. Some keyboards in this price range have 16-, 24 -or 28-note polyphony; the DGX500 has a full 32-note polyphony so you can play intricate instrumental arrangements and dense musical passages without running out of notes or sounds.When you want to record your playing, just press the front panel's record button, the track button for the track you want to record on, and start playing. It's that easy. When you're done, save your song internally or to the keyboard's 3.5-inch floppy disk drive as a standard MIDI file (SMF) to make it compatible with other general MIDI keyboards as well as most computers. Imagine recording your child's first song onto a disk, placing it in your computer and attaching it to e-mail so friends and family can hear.Call up your favorite style of music like Rock, Big Band, Gospel or Country, press a chord or play Single Finger mode, and the DGX505 will follow you through a piece of music, providing all of the drums, bass, piano, guitar, horn and string parts for you. And even though the DGX505 comes with 135 built-in music styles, the disk drive opens up the ability to load even more. The disk drive will allow you to save and organize your favorite data for years to come. Another feature to simplify song playing is the music database. Pull out your favorite music book, select a song from any of the over 200 songs in the database, and the entire keyboard sets itself up. Start playing and the keyboard will follow your every chord--with no other buttons to press.The DGX505 comes with 100 built-in songs with its songbook feature. But if you've never played before, where do you start? Well, if learning to play music is important to you, the Yamaha Education Suite II, a set of music training functions, makes learning music incredibly easy. Seven types of lessons are available as well as a convenient chord dictionary.And finally, no matter what level of playing ability your at, you'll appreciate being able to build combinations of your favorite sounds. Pressing the Split button divides the instrument into two parts, allowing you to have two different sounds on the keyboard at the same time, like piano on the right and bass on the left. That's when you really appreciate the 88 keys.In addition, Layer mode lets you combine two sounds across the keyboard range. For example, you could layer piano and strings and play both sounds at the same time. With over 600 voices to choose from, the combinations are only limited by your imagination.Full Stereo sound with 2-way speakers -88 full size Touch sensitive keys - Tutorial modes with grading - Tons of great features, too many to list This piano will satisfy even an accomplished pianist with its sophistication and stunning full room filling sound.  Yet, its simple enough to turn on and begin playing for even the youngest beginner.  Read any reviews on-line and owners just rave about it.    The piano is in excellent condition and works 100%.  Its includes the power cord and the foot petal.  It will be professionally packed for shipping.  Any questions or concerns, feel free to email.  Original Retail price was $1169.95 and that was a steal for this piano."

All of our instruments, old and new, are set up in our world-class repair shop before we display them in our showroom or advertise them online. When you buy from Keith Holland Guitars, you can rest assured that you're in good hands and that your instrument will be ready to play out of the box.The 90's era iteration of the famous Memory Man (affectionately dubbed the big box) is possibly the most sought after analog delay pedal in the world, and for good reason. It offers insane depth and control over the modulation effects and the results range from subtle to pure sonic madness. The interesting thing about the modulation is that is produces a Doppler pitch shifting in the delay signal.Overall this pedal is in Very Good Condition. There is some natural wear to the enclosure with some notable scratches (see pics for clarification), but in great condition for its age.It comes with original wooden box, ac adapter, operating guide and other cool EHX paraphernalia."

                "description": "For sale is a Retro Instruments 500PRE 500 Series Tube preamp. This pre is very versatile, can sounds clear and crystalline, adding a shimmering texture with larger than life low-end and glimmering top-end, or get quite distorted and gritty depending on how hard you push the gain stage. It has the same circuit topology as Retro's famous Sta-level with 76db of gain, so can drive any ribbon mic. Knobs are not stepped. The thing is built incredibly well, all switches and knobs are solid. Have used it for maybe a total of 10 hours in the studio. Sad to sell this pre, but I'm moving overseas and liquidating all my recording gear. Please let me know if you have any questions.Also selling the 500 series lunchbox if interested for $150."
