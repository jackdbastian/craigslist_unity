Purchased used, in new condition, in 2012.  Was in home studio (no smokin) service until 2016.  In storage since.A scan from the owners manual, displayed here, shows how Mackie defines it as a 12 channel mixer.Includes padded Gig Skinz carry bag and Mackie dust cover.Includes optional 96kHz FireWire card that was originally available for streaming 14 independent channels of audio to computer.  Since Mackie stopped supporting drivers, it may or may NOT have that functionality on a Mac.  Definitely not on a Windows platform as of the last time I contacted Mackie in 2016.From Mackie: The Mackie Onyx 1220 12-Channel Mixer is a small-format analog mixer. Includes 4 boutique-class Onyx mic preamps with 3-band Perkins EQ plus sweepable mids on mic/line channels. . . .Includes aux sends with pre/post switches, 4 stereo line-level inputs, a talkback section for use with internal or external mics, true hardware EQ bypass, and a Planet-Earth switching power supply for worldwide use.

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
