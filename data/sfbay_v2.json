In 1990 I attended a church charity event in San Bruno, Ca and these gloves were one of the bidding items. There was a bidding war with about 6 of us, however the reserve was not met and these gloves were not sold. They were held for the next years charity event. In 1991 I again attended this event.  These gloves were once again on the block. There was another bidding war with approx. 6-10 others. I won the bid and my cost was $425.00, however that was only for charity. The entire time they have been in a vented box, climate house and never put on. Both are in pristine, brand new unblemished condition. At the time of win/sale (1991) I was given a professional document of authenticity from the church with dates, serial number etc. At one point I put it in our safety deposit box, then there was a move to another bank box. At this point we can't find the document in our files. I have contacted the church. It's been 30 years and this church no longer puts on these sport type of charitable events. We wrote to the George Foreman's Offical web site. We are waiting for a response back. I have no idea what these are worth, however a George Foreman fan should have them.... $75.00........Thank you"

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible and in total cost over $1500). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5000 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
