Not just as 1910-1940's fashion statement.Beautiful full Mink Stole, natural dark brown fur colors, with 6 tails and 2 heads incorporated in the design.Good Condition stole with 6 full mink pelts. This was all the rage in the 20's and 30's. Very fine mink with great style and unique snap fastener to hold them together.Vintage: 1910-1940Source: unknown, no label inside, but assumed a Wisconsin-based Furrier.Condition: See photos. Has been stored in a clothes trunk in the attic for over half a century so it will need to be cleaned. Lining will need to be replaced. 3 of the tails will need to be re-attached.$35------------------------------------See our other and upcoming CL ads for more Vintage & Collectible Clothing - Leather & Furs, Dress-up, Casual, soccer, men's, women's, Hats, Shoes. 1890's-1980's.

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
