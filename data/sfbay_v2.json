The bottom/ train may have a bit dirt, but can be dry cleaned if wish. Not noticeable unless someone examine closely.Color is ivory champagne. Since my background wall is yellow, it's pretty hard to depict the exact color of the gown.The color shown on the close up corset photo looks more accurate since it's set against the white dust cover.Label size is 4, but was altered down to size 1-2.Waist size about 24.Bust about 30-32.Comes with long train, but can be adjusted/ lifted up from inside buttons."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

Very FAST and transparent EL84 cathode biased amp. Beautiful harmonic distortion without NFB. No tradesPlease note if you order this amp directly from Nik @ Ceriatone, there is a 2-3 month lead-time and international shipping costs & import duties is an added ~$200. All reasonable offer will be considered.The Ceriatone TW series represents our take on yet another famous, rare amplifier line from the United States.The Ceriatone C-Wreck is heavily inspired by an interesting collaboration between the builder of the aforementioned line and another great modern American amp builder.  In topology, it has many similarities to the Rock It!, however we feel this is a further refinement of the design.  The C-Wreck offers a slightly different feel and perhaps an even more satisfying overdriven tone.  As with the Rock It!, the clean and mildly overdriven tones are second to none.Like the other amplifiers from this builder, much of the brilliance in the design is in its simplicity and no-compromises approach to component placement, lead dress, and trying to maintain as unaltered a signal path as possible.  We have kept this approach, but allowed flexibility by offering two different output transformer primary impedances for slightly different feel and harmonic content.Like other Ceriatone amps, we have labored carefully to select the finest components to suit the design, and the Expression uses our specially designed and correct specification custom transformers for superior reliability, frequency response, and feel.Head Dimension : 18.75 x 9.5 x 10.75 inches / Actual Weight : 16kgPower Output\t30 WattFeature Overview\tSingle channelVolume, Treble, Bass, Cut, and Master Volume Controls3-way Bright SwitchHalf Power switch (removes a pair of EL84s and simultaneously rebiases)Fast / Warm Select (selects between high or low plate voltage)Tubes\tPower: 4 x EL84Preamp: 3 x 12AX7/ECC83Rectifier: 5AR4 / GZ34#DR Z #Matchless #Vox #Bad Cat #Two Rock #Fender #Marshall #Mesa #Boutique #HiWatt #AC30"
