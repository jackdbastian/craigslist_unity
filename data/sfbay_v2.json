                "description": "I had a southwest store in Sonoma County years ago and closed it in 1995. I personally went to New Mexico in the 1980s and early 1990s and worked with the Native American Indians and southwest artisans for this Peyote Bird Designs vintage but new hand beaded artisan watch bracelet, necklace and 5 strand bracelet.  Peyote Bird Designs is out of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Beautiful Peyote Bird watch has a hand crafted band signed by Don Lucas. The watch and necklace also has Peyote Bird Designs Hallmark stamped on the back of watch and on a charm on the necklace showing that it is a Peyote Bird Designs original.The vintage but new watch has been in storage since 1995 and has never been worn and is still in it's original box as you can see in the photos in this ad.   So it is vintage but new.  I also have a beautifully handcrafted matching necklace and bracelet.  These can be bought as a set or purchased separately.  There is a discount if more than one item is purchased. The Peyote Bird watch has a triple strand beaded band with genuine Amethyst and Onyx and other types of beads, one with small heart, star and flower sterling silver charms signed Don Lucas.   Watch and band components, charms etc are sterling silver.   The chain at one end makes the watch size adjustable and has a tiny Peyote Bird charm marked sterling, the other end has a hook to loop through the chain to fasten the band.   The third item is a Peyote Bird Designs beaded bracelet with black, white and silver with some purple very old beads has an African theme with an elephant, lion, hippo and zebra sterling silver charms.  The clasp is a authentic Indian head nickel.  Bracelet is vintage but new.  Never worn.The watch currently needs a battery that I can take care of once the watch is sold.   The watch and band are very sturdy and unique.  The band has hand tooled sterling silver, multi semi precious stones plus two charms have Onyx stones mounted in them as well as the stem for winding the watch also has Onyx. The watch face is 1 1/8 wide including stem. This western charm watch bracelets length is about 7 but can be made larger by using the additional chain links.  The watch band is a standout to layer with your Peyote Bird beaded bracelet, jewel tone or silver bracelets.   Made by Don Lucas and sold by Sundance in the 1980's and 1990's, it is a stunner. Hallmark stamped on back of watch.  Quartz Timepiece.  The watch will come in the original box.  Consider this for the one who loves designer signed vintage southwestern jewelry.PRICE CHARM WATCH:     $399PRICE MATCHING NECKLACE:    $125PRICE MATCHING BEADED AFRICAN THEME BRACELET:  $200DISCOUNT FOR PURCHASING MORE THAN ONE PIECE OF SET IS 5% If interested call or text Rebecca at  .

                "description": "I had a southwest store in Sonoma County years ago and closed it in 1995. I personally went to New Mexico and Arizona and worked with the Native American Indians for the jewelry I have available in this ad.  These rings have been in storage and never worn since 1995.  I'm offering the following rings in the 6 1/2 and 7-1/2 size range.  See pictures with ring sizer for exact measurements.1). This is a vintage Hopi signed TJ and stamped sterling silver story teller ring.  The Hopi tribe is a sovereign nation located in northeastern Arizona.   There are only 12 villages on three mesas.   The population is around 19,000 Hopi's in the United States.  So jewelry by the Hopi's is limited meaning the jewelry tends to be more expensive than the Navajo pieces.  The ring is a size around 7 1/2.  It's width is 1/2. Makes a great and unusual wedding band.  Price:   $2003). The last vintage ring I have is Navajo with a sterling silver beaded band.  Not sure what the yellow/amber colored stone is but it has been carved by the artist.  Size is about a 6 1/2 - 7.  This is probably a 1970's ring.    Priced:   $150If interested please call or text Rebecca at  .  I live in a smoke and pet free environment.  CASH ONLY"

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and the power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height (not too low)*Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
