No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"

You can really dial in almost any tone you're looking for with the TVP (True Valve Power--allows you to shape your tone based on highly accurate power tube models) and ISF (Infinite Shape Feature--allows you to choose between American and British mid-range tones)  controls. DISCLOSURE: There is a crack in the cabinet (see last pic). This is due to Guitar Center not knowing how to pack a heavy amp for shipping. However, this crack does not affect the tone or function of the amp. In terms of structural integrity, the cabinet still feels VERY SOLID, as the crack does not move nor do any of the cabinet panels. If it were not for this crack, this amp would be considered to be in EXCELLENT condition.REASON FOR SELLING: I'm more into floor-based amp modelers/effect processors, e.g. Headrush, Line 6, etc. these days. And I'm moving so it's time to clean out the garage.Feel free to reach out with any questions or to schedule a time if you'd like to come by and check it out."

This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades.

Previously owner was the original owner and hardly played it, and (shame on me) neither did I, the second owner. My teacher is most famous as a timbales player, so I wanted to take it up. But I realize now that I don't have the bandwidth to pick it up while also learning bongos and congas (not to mention guitar, woodwinds, harmonica...I have a lot of interests!). And now I need to collect funds for a recent surgery. Hence the reluctant sale!Everything is from JCR, except the Bullfrog block (which came with the set when I bought it) and the LP cha-cha bell (which I bought new). Set also comes with the JCR stand, and a couple of non-JCR bags which don't look like they were necessarily for timbales, but they do the job. JCR, the man and master maker, is no longer with us on earth. And neither is his company. So no more JCR timbales are being made. It's hard enough to find one for sale. From what I see online, this is one of the few left in the world in this kind of excellent condition available for sale!"

No low ballers or trade offers pleaseWhat is the Acidbox lll? --> Erica Synths Acidbox III brings you the core of the famous Polivoks VCF in stereo version with a unique audio signal overdrive circuit, built in LFO and envelope follower in a compact, full aluminium case. Features Polivoks core stereo lowpass/bandpass VCF with the original programmable opamps Unique audio overdrive circuit Versatile syncable LFO with 8 waveforms Tap tempo button Envelope follower with modulation level attenuverter Master modulation control Manual and CV control over cutoff frequency Configurable control input for footswitch, expression pedal and external LFO/cutoff control Adjustable input gain The Acidbox III has adjustable input gain, therefore it works with various sound sources \u2013 guitars, units with line level signals (synthesizers, grooveboxes, etc.) and modular synths. Configurable control input allows you to connect a bypass footswitch, expression pedal, external cutoff control voltage source and LFO synchronization trigger. This makes the Acidbox an ideal companion in almost every production or live performance setup. A characterful, gritty analogue effect, made all the more flexible by its stereo signal path and modulation options. -Future Music Magazinelists Acidbox III among the best new studio gear of 2018 The acidbox III should appeal to many, thanks to its flexibility. On the most basic of levels, the stereo I/O makes it a perfect addition to a DJ rig, where real-time filtering is easy to control and trip in and out, thanks to the Bypass switch. The envelope follower will appeal to live musicians and there is nothing to stop users from using pedals to control elements such as Bypass on the fly. The Polivoks filter is characterful, with tons of charm, but very dirty with it \u2013 and as a useful colour in a number of settings, this could become a very valuable piece of kit for both live and studio work. - MusicTech Magazine rates Acidbox III 9 out of 10! Erica Synths has finally made the Acidbox' third generation - stereo capable and thus hits the bull's eye. Now it can be applied to all types of signals: for flat mono synths, as a strong character filter or as a special effect in the DJ Booth. On top of that, guitarists and bass players can hook up their instruments and indulge in the funk creating by Envelope Follower shaping the input signal. The Acidbox III can also sound warm, but if you're looking for a comforting soft filter then you should look elsewhere. The Acidbox III sounds confidently different and immediately delivers inspiring results.tags: #moog #oberheim #waldorf #Boss #Pioneer #Yamaha #Roland #Korg #Meris #Strymon #Eurorack #EHX #DeathByAudio"
