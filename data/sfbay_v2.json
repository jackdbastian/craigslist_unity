I am the second owner.  It has been driven very few miles during the pandemic and shelter-in-place. The entire vehicle is in excellent condition inside and out \u2013 \u201cClean.\u201dGreat specimen of the Classic American 4x4.Upgraded exhaust to MagnaFlow stainless steel  \u2014 sounds awesome! ($700 plus installation)Recently installed new springs and spark plugs.I have wanted to keep this car, but no longer have room to park it (it\u2019s at mom\u2019s house and she needs the space).If I kept it, this is what I would do:1)\tSteering linkages & ball joints. 2)\tTCC Solenoid and/or Torque Converter (it has thrown P0740, and downshifts into 1st gear are not 100%.           Selling \u201cas-is\u201d \u2013 hopefully to someone who would enjoy fixing this). I\u2019d love to sell to a mechanically-inclined buyer \u2013 someone capable of maintaining it. Included:  a Felpro Engine Rebuild Kit (new gaskets), new motor mounts, a new distributor cap, some transmission pieces, and the original airbox."

Meticulously maintained by the previous owner. Only a single owner car!Great for courier companies, commuting, van life, camping and chilling.Clean title; clean accident history.No issues whatsoever; perfectly maintained.This will run for a long time!I triple check and check for things four or five times sometimes, as I am a bit of a perfectionist. You want to buy from someone like me.Not like other sellers who leave mechanical or cosmetic issues to repair or fix or do not disclose them to you.No hidden problems, really a fantastic car.This is the best value if you need a van for the following reasons;1. The mileage is low, so it's super reliable2. It's old, so parts are cheap3. It's old, so there is a lot of room to do repairs, less unnecessary components, so it's great to fix your self or get fixed very cheaply.I have a car repair business with five employees, I can fix most issues for you for almost free after you buy the car. So you can also come back to me for maintenance and repairs. I also have a credit card reader to take payments instead of cash."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "For sale is a Pleyel Model P 131, SN #262710 purchased new 2006. Piano has been scrumptiously maintained. Has had light use. Hammers are in terrific condition. Cabinet is unmarred. Tuning pins are tight. String wire is shiny. Has been kept in a very stable environment with proper humidity.This instrument may have an obscure brand, but the company has had a rich history as a piano of choice to Chopin, Debussy, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Ravel, de Falla and Stravinsky. Many famous piano instructors also chose Pleyel \u2013 read about in the Wikipedia. Pleyels rise above the other mass-produced pianos like Yamaha, Kawai and Petrof. They are more comparable to Schimmel. As they are not produced in great volume, the construction is more crafted. If you read the piano forums, folks tend to come back and purchase the Pleyel. They really do stand out above others.\u2022\tConsistent quality\u2022\tSweet sound and powerful bass section\u2022\tExcellent dynamic ability\u2022\tRenner action including hammers special to this piano\u2022\tAction touch is slightly lighter than average\u2022\tVery robust frame (piano weighs over 600 lbs)\u2022\tGorgeous wood graining and finish. Top notch.Recommend you play the Kawai, Yamaha, etc. first and then try this instrument. It is likely your last stop! There are extremely few that are being sold used. Most musicians keep them once acquired."

                "description": "The Yamaha YBS-52 is the little brother to the famous YBS-62 .It's not the most expensive bari sax but it is the most popular bari sax made today . It is recommended by just about every saxophone teacher .It gives you the most bang for the buck . It is thousands of dollars cheaper than the 62 but has has exactly the same scale and key work with the exception of no high F# key ( but who needs it ! )Bari saxes in general tend to get pretty beat up . It's a big instrument . This one is in above average condition . There are signs of some dent removal but it is nice and straight with good lacquer.It has had all dents taken out , lacquer touched up , body joint sealed , re assembled and regulated .It plays great and has a real BARK to the bottom end .This is a later upgraded model withe tilting low Bb touchThe original case is in good  condition . The case sometimes takes more of a beating than the sax .retail price is over $8000 , internet price is around $5600 . Save yourself a couple of thousand dollars and get a bari that plays as good as new if not better.It comes with everything needed to play it . . I also have bari's below this one .  As far as I can see it is the only nice used one around for sale !Only e-mails with ph # will be replied to"
