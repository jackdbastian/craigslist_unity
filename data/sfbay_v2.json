Fair condition- a little bit of rust on the front panel, and the volume knobs crackle a bit when sweeping at lower volumes. I've owned it for about a decade, but haven't used it for a few years. Sounds great despite the crackle, much to loud for my needs these days. *The amp says 180W on the back, but the general internet consensus is that means 60W."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

Original pickup is included. Priced to sell at $1500.Thanks!Sascha Bringing to life the vision of one of the most respected guitarists in the world, the Eric Johnson Signature Stratocaster Thinline is the perfect marriage between a semi-hollow body and a traditional Stratocaster. Johnson is famous in guitar circles for questing for his ideal tone\u2014liquid and articulate, it perfectly complements the playing style that earned his place in the modern guitar pantheon. In 2015 he approached us to co-design a lightweight, resonant instrument that combines the tones of his favorite semi-hollowbody guitars and his Stratocaster. Two years later, we hit the formula for tonal nirvana with the Eric Johnson Signature Stratocaster Thinline.This guitar is used but is in great shape!

                "description": "Do not pass on this instrument, if you are looking at this, then you know the reputation of the Mark VI, and this one is a good example. This would also be a great investment unlike a new sax that would depreciate in value.This sax plays nice and has that tone the Mark VI is famous for. Original finish but does show slight wear, but very nice for it\u2019s age. No dents & the serial numbers do match, and the original case is in very good condition. Please email with any questions."
