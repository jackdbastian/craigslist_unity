Next 3 pics are photos of the dress on me. Spent a ton on the dress, nothing on the photographer. Big mistake!Since it is a corset back, it's difficult to get the exact measurements of the dress - it has an inch or so give in either direction.It has a thread to mark where the dress can be tied up in the back when you don't want a train anymore.It was only worn once, the day of my wedding. I absolutely loved the dress, and should have gotten more pictures the day-of of the back of the dress!AlterationsThe dress was taken in to fit me better. The measurements given above are the measurements of the dress currently, not pre-alteration."

If you are a woodwind player and you need a brass or string layer on recording , no need to hire anyone else . You can do it.    It has a built in speaker and can run on batteries so you can play it anywhere !I can be upgraded via your computer and has been just graded to the latest version    If you are non wind player the Aerophone has a very short learning curve since no embouchure is needed , just blow and wiggle your fingers   This one is in a rare  grey color . Most are whiteIncluded is the Aerophone  , case , all the original paperwork , AC power supply . rechargeable batteries and an EXTRA  mouthpiece  ( $60 value ) that is not included for the factory . It is in asnew condition    I have played and owned EVERY  wind concroller from the original AKAI  EWI up to the Yamaha  WX-5 and I feel this one it the best so farSave over  $200 off the new pricesee demo  at   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqhHVfNQmHg             also  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUr0YmbIRhk"

                "description": "I have a brand new Crescendo full-size intermediate/advanced hand-crafted Violin. Since I play anything with strings, I have other violins, guitars, mandolins, etc., etc., ~ this one I bought as a collectors item and I spent a pretty penny on her. She is in mint condition. I also have multiple chin rests, shoulder rests (all high-dollar) I also have 6 bows, from white horsehair, to blackhair, and many others. The one pictured here is a genuine Jon Krausche. I also paid a pretty penny (or two) for this rare wooden bow. I believe that the wood (Pernambuco with Mongolian Horse Hair) is no longer legal to manufacture. This information came through a famous teacher in the SF area. I have ALL of the accessories (and even more) a Violinist might want. I will negotiate things like the limited edition of the Devils Violinist DVD featuring David Garrett as Paginini (life story) ~ I have multiple Rosins, dark, light and everything in between including New Strings ($$) ~ I bought this Violin to hang on to as an investment, but my guitar playing has taken over once again and I just can't stand to see my baby sit and collect dust. The case is insane. It has zippers, locks, clamps, clips, multiple compartments throughout ($$$) .. there is nothing crappy or cheap about this puppy. I'm asking a 'low-ball' price for the Violin. Talk to me and we will negotiate all of the other accessories (I even have two electric pickups that attach if needed)... I can't think of anything else. Just look at the photos closely. If you play, you will know what you are seeing in the pile of accessories, which are also brand new. I learned what I wanted to with my Carbon Fiber Violin and I just fell back to the Guitar (going on 50 years of playing now) ~ you WILL have to meet me in downtown Sonora. I will come of the Mountain to meet you. In speaking with me you will decide. If you make the trip (about 2 hours from SF) .. you will purchase her and likely many accessories. I've kept the price down so that you can afford the accessories YOU need for YOUR body. I paid aprox $1000.00 for the Violin. All the accessories are high-quality. No cheap junk. The bows are all rare woods. Multiple (4) holders inside case, tube, sheet music pouches and thermometer. Velour cover, etc... it's everything you need for intermediate players. This is not for a beginner, unless you want to just purchase something NICE right off the bat and spare the misery of a junker. Call me. Thanks!"

Original G12H-75 Creamback loaded (I can load this with a UK made V30 If you prefer)Small hairline crack near power port is the only notable, no other issues. Super clean and sounds amazing. Original box from Wildwood Guitars if you want it.This this is a Marshall lovers dream. Channel 1 is the best vintage Plexi tone around, hands down. Hendrix to Malcom Young here. Channel 2 is everything from low gain modern crunch to saturated modern gains with just enough compression. Should mention this amp loves pedal too, takes fuzz, drives, effects perfectly. Friedman makes one of the quietest, usable effect loops around for your Delays, Reverbs etc.Check what used prices are on these. Lotsa clips on YouTube. Channel 1's lower gain Plexi tone is pure gold and where I lived. I've owned easily over a dozen Marshall type circuit amps, this is at the top. Of course channel 2 is all about Friedman's famous high gain BBE mod/model and this is what put him on the map so if your looking for EVH to George Lynch to GnR's or even drop D sludge, look no further.No trades, weird inquiries'. Come with cash, leave with a lifetime amp.Fender Bogner Ampeg Diezel Carr Peavey Dr Z Two Rock VHT Engl Vox Budda Suhr Mesa Egnator PRS Orange Matchless Blackstar Line 6 Kemper Yamaha Boss"
