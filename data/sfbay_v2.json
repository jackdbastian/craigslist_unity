Built like a tank and can get LOUD but still gives great tube sounds even at low volumes. It\u2019s a very versatile amp \u2014 the clean channel is sparkling clean and each channel adds gain with metal tones achievable at the other end. I\u2019ve been the only owner of this amp for the past 11 years and it\u2019s only been gigged once or twice in that time. It\u2019s essentially in mint condition.

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
