                "description": "Purchased this stunning lace gown brand new for our wedding in Fall 2019.  We were planning on finding it a new home last year, but well, you know, the world shut down.  So 2021 it is! It\u2019s in excellent condition: no rips, tears, snags, or stains. The very bottom edge of the dress is a little dirty in front (normal dance floor dirt), but it should come out easily with a little spot cleaning, or you could get the whole dress dry cleaned. It was more comfortable than most dresses I tried on, and light boning in the torso provides support and security. I absolutely loved this dress (so did my spouse!) and got tons of compliments from our guests.We made two modifications to this dress:1) Had three simple hooks and loops attached to bustle the dress.  Total life saver, especially on the dance floor! (See photos)2) At the shoulder seam where you'd normally get the dress altered to fit you, we decided to take in the entirety of the shoulders and turn the gown into a halter.  We did not have any fabric cut off or removed- the shoulder fabric is meticulously folded in and sewn into the dress, so when you get the gown tailored to fit you, you can either leave it as a halter or return it to its shouldered state. The halter connects with a silver necklace with hidden closure. (See photos)I included some of our wedding photos so you can see the dress in action.  It photographs great, in color and B&W.More information, specs, and photos here:https://www.bhldn.com/products/ludlow-gown?color=Almond%2FIvory&size=6If you haven\u2019t already tried on this dress, this isn\u2019t a confusing wedding dress size. My normal dress size is 4, and this dress fit me perfectly at size 4, no alterations for size were necessary. I\u2019m 5\u2019 6.5\u201d and wore 3\u201d wedges, and the dress grazed the ground in front.BHLDN still sells this dress, so hey, go try it, and then buy it from us and save on the price and no tax :).  For serious local inquiries, I'm sure we can figure out a way for you to try it on.Anthropologie, BHLDN, Wedding"

This is a 60W Head with Footswitch that controls overdrive, reverb and second channel.The amp is in great condition, no rips in tolex, light use touring and studio work.The cleanest tone ever. I went with a combo for ease of touring/shows so selling this head, no cab.Here's some info on the head:The classic modded-Marshall tone. Bogner is well-known for their top-quality tone. The Shiva is infamous for great clean tone plus hot-rodded rock tones, and this amp delivers. At 80W, it is suitable for any size club, and the Master volume makes it home-friendly as well.This amp is recently tubed and biased. It is the most recent circuit (11 knob, NOT 20th anniversary). This gives excellent flexibility in using the boost, especially for channel 2.Clean, clear tone, cuts through ANY mix. The EL34 power section is the right level of power and character for the famous musical power tube breakup, and the tone is flexible enough for any style of music.This amp is in excellent physical condition.Switchable speaker impedance control makes it compatible with 4, 8 and 16 Ohms. It will drive a small 1x12 or a full 4x12 stack.This amp has reverb and a separate reverb level control for each channel. Reverb is also switchable.There is an effects loop that allows for four-cable connection to effects for best tone.--Firm on price, pickup in San Anselmo studio.Don"

                "description": "Since you see this ad now, it means that Deep Mind 12 is STILL AVAILABLE.Behringer's famous first analog synth, Deep Mind 12. True analog, 12-voice poly, 4x effects engines, 8x modulation matrix, 1024 patches onboard. Commonly known as Juno on steroids, the modern incarnation of Juno-106 (for the look and bunch of buttons and sliders), it's actually closer to more advanced Juno-60 and JX series. Think JX-10 with all these Juno sliders and  a PG-800 programmer built in. I had and have most of classic analog polysynths, the last one was JX-10 with Vecoven upgrade (cost me over $1300), but even that one doesn't come close to DM12 in sound, features and ease of use. Nothing can beat the feeling of just grabbing a slider and adjusting the value right away, instead of recalling parameter first, then adjusting it, then recalling another, like on JX. You can even play with two or more sliders at once, like cutoff and resonance. There's no way you can do it on any JX.12-voice polyphony does make the difference, you'll never have cut notes as it happens with 6-voice synths like Juno, JX-8P or Polysix.DM12 is analog fanatics' heaven: everything you wished an old Juno or JX had is here, already implemented. IMHO it's the dream analog polysynth: plenty of sliders on surface for instant tweaking like on Junos and Jupiters, and a large graphic display for in-depth editing (no external programmer or software editors are needed). DM12 has a lot more editable parameters than surface allows, so combination of physical sliders for most critical parameters and on-screen menus for everything else is the best, like for effects parameters (it has no less than 4 separate effects engines made by TC Electronics, makers of legendary studio rack effect units like 2290, M-One and D-Two). Plus, an insane 1024 memories onboard (instead 32 to128 on classics) make it quite usable even for live performances. I'd take it over Nord Lead, Novation Peak or Prophet-6 any day!DM12 are becoming rare, since they are no longer produced, and Behringer now is focusing on producing the exact copies of the classic synthesizers. DM12 is an original design, and while it has a lot of layout and sonic similarities with Junos, it's far more advanced and superior to all of them, in a small package with solid all-metal design.  Watch videos for sound samples, more detailed overview of features and comparisons to classic synths.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynm44MeqPfk&feature=emb_logoVery detailed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8B6HJ2chQThis DM12 is in great shape, practically new, not even a single scratch anywhere. Selling only because I mostly play live and need more universal synth like Kronos or Montage. My price is fair: they are no longer produced and becoming rare (especially in new condition like mine). Be way of online buys: some sellers won't tell you everything, and in case of problems you'll be paying for return shipment anyway, IF seller accepts returns (most don't).Low-ball offers: No reply means that your offer went straight to trash. I don't need to know how much they are on eBay, or that somebody is selling it for less or is willing to give it to you for free: if he does, go and get that one.Thanks for looking!"
