                "description": "Up for sale is my Simon and Patrick Woodland Pro parlor guitar, with installed K&K pure mini pickup. Features a solid spruce top, solid mahogany back and sides, in a lovely sunburst finish. Rosewood fretboard and bridge. Beautiful inlaid wood rosette around the soundhole. Made by Simon and Patrick, a subsidiary of Godin, this guitar was built in Canada. Awesome guitar, great for traveling or noodling on the couch. This is a full, 24 7/8 scale guitar with the join at the 12th fret for extra volume and resonance. Sounds awesome, and for such a small guitar can get surprisingly loud. I had a K&K Pure Mini transducer pickup professionally installed by the good folks at Guitar Solo, so it can be plugged in for playing through an amp, PA, or audio interface. Best part is that it\u2019s a passive pickup, so no need for batteries and no controls to mess with. I\u2019ve made a quick demo video to give you an idea of how it sounds here: https://youtu.be/2kwUEB2BE6cHasn\u2019t been set up in a while (4 years or so), but still plays great. In the interests of transparency, during the last setup the guitar tech found a slight hump in the fretboard around the body join, so while the action is low and quite playable, it\u2019s not as low as possible. I wasn\u2019t bothered by it, and it\u2019s a pretty involved process to correct, so I left it as is.Comes with original hardshell case, which has dings and dents, but is structurally sound and all latches and hardware work fine.Happy to let you audition the guitar in my garage.Asking $550 or best offer. The only other example on sale on Reverb is $750, and historically goes anywhere from $450-700, so I think this is a great deal with the added pickup. Also, happy to deliver in the Bay Area, depending on distance. Sorry, no trades.If you're interested, please email this listing with a phone number. If the ad is still up, the guitar is still available."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.

                "description": "Since you see this ad now, it means that Deep Mind 12 is STILL AVAILABLE.Behringer's famous first analog synth, Deep Mind 12. True analog, 12-voice poly, 4x effects engines, 8x modulation matrix, 1024 patches onboard. Commonly known as Juno on steroids, the modern incarnation of Juno-106 (for the look and bunch of buttons and sliders), it's actually closer to more advanced Juno-60 and JX series. Think JX-10 with all these Juno sliders and  a PG-800 programmer built in. I had and have most of classic analog polysynths, the last one was JX-10 with Vecoven upgrade (cost me over $1300), but even that one doesn't come close to DM12 in sound, features and ease of use. Nothing can beat the feeling of just grabbing a slider and adjusting the value right away, instead of recalling parameter first, then adjusting it, then recalling another, like on JX. You can even play with two or more sliders at once, like cutoff and resonance. There's no way you can do it on any JX.12-voice polyphony does make the difference, you'll never have cut notes as it happens with 6-voice synths like Juno, JX-8P or Polysix.DM12 is analog fanatics' heaven: everything you wished an old Juno or JX had is here, already implemented. IMHO it's the dream analog polysynth: plenty of sliders on surface for instant tweaking like on Junos and Jupiters, and a large graphic display for in-depth editing (no external programmer or software editors are needed). DM12 has a lot more editable parameters than surface allows, so combination of physical sliders for most critical parameters and on-screen menus for everything else is the best, like for effects parameters (it has no less than 4 separate effects engines made by TC Electronics, makers of legendary studio rack effect units like 2290, M-One and D-Two). Plus, an insane 1024 memories onboard (instead 32 to128 on classics) make it quite usable even for live performances. I'd take it over Nord Lead, Novation Peak or Prophet-6 any day!DM12 are becoming rare, since they are no longer produced, and Behringer now is focusing on producing the exact copies of the classic synthesizers. DM12 is an original design, and while it has a lot of layout and sonic similarities with Junos, it's far more advanced and superior to all of them, in a small package with solid all-metal design.  Watch videos for sound samples, more detailed overview of features and comparisons to classic synths.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynm44MeqPfk&feature=emb_logoVery detailed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8B6HJ2chQThis DM12 is in great shape, practically new, not even a single scratch anywhere. Selling only because I mostly play live and need more universal synth like Kronos or Montage. My price is fair: they are no longer produced and becoming rare (especially in new condition like mine). Be way of online buys: some sellers won't tell you everything, and in case of problems you'll be paying for return shipment anyway, IF seller accepts returns (most don't).Low-ball offers: No reply means that your offer went straight to trash. I don't need to know how much they are on eBay, or that somebody is selling it for less or is willing to give it to you for free: if he does, go and get that one.Thanks for looking!"
