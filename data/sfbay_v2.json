It is modern and clean with an empire waist and mermaid fitted shape. The dress was altered from the original to add the sleeves, create the floor-length mermaid shape, and add a pale green band around the waist that ends with two flower details and pale green ribbons trailing from the back. The dress is extremely flattering and comfortable to wear. It has a sophisticated simplicity to it, with a touch of detailing at the neckline and the waist band. It can be somewhat difficult to raise arms in the dress due to the fitted shape. Worn just once, professionally dry-cleaned and stored in an archival storage box."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."
