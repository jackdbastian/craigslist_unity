Peyote Bird Designs is out of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Beautiful Peyote Bird watch has a hand crafted band signed by Don Lucas. The watch and necklace also has Peyote Bird Designs Hallmark stamped on the back of watch and on a charm on the necklace showing that it is a Peyote Bird Designs original.The vintage but new watch has been in storage since 1995 and has never been worn and is still in it's original box as you can see in the photos in this ad.   So it is vintage but new.  I also have a beautifully handcrafted matching necklace and bracelet.  These can be bought as a set or purchased separately.
