This dress is perfect for a wine-country wedding.  It has a satin rose and bow that attaches to the back.  You may attach a train if you prefer.   I'm guessing it's about a US size 8 -10,  sized for 5'3 tall.  I paid @  US $1,100.00 when I purchased it from a bridal shop in Sydney, Australia.  Asking for only $130.00 but will consider your offer."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

All the classic Roland kits and then some...building custom kits is easy and fun with my own sounds.What is the TR-8S? --> Born of the most famous and influential drum machines ever made, the TR-8S combines the best of its Roland heritage with modern production techniques and professional sound design. The result? A forward-thinking, performance-tuned instrument unlike any other. Build your dream kit from the most iconic drum sounds of all time, plus the finest selection of stereo samples from a vast sound library -- or import your own custom samples. Tap, tune and tweak with hands-on controls and production tools that make your patterns move and groove. And why keep this kind of percussive power confined to the studio? The TR-8S was literally made to play live.Transistor RhythmsThe TR-8S has every sound from the most sought-after TR drum machines, with detailed circuit-models of the 808, 606, 909, 707, 727, 626 and even several modified versions. These are not sound-alike sample-packs or mere recordings of TR drum sounds. Each machine is a detailed, down-to-the-circuit-model that sounds and behaves exactly like the original hardware. All these sounds are yours, at your fingertips, and ready to use in your own productions and performances.#Roland #Korg #Moog #DaveSmith #Arturia #Eurorack"
