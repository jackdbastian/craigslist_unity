Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "This is a very nice, handmade Mountain Dulcimer in the Hourglass shape made from Folkcraft Instruments. This instrument was handmade in Winsted, Connecticut by legendary dulcimer maker (according to Hayley Speakman of Folkcraft Instruments), either the famous David Marks in their shop in Winsted, CT sometime around 1989.  On the inside is HC? with 486 -H an hourglass shape, and C which means it is solid cherry and , and something else ?). On his nicer instruments, David Marks usually included the 6.5 fret and the 13.5 fret so that is an additional clue as to it's maker. It is entirely solid cherry wood and has a 27 scale. This instrument is in amazing condition and cost at least $800 - 1000 in 1989.  I think $360 right now, make me an offer. You are invited out to Walnut Creek to check it out. Soft case and a set of strings included. Call, text, or email if interested."
