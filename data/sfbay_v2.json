                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "For sale is a Pleyel Model P 131, SN #262710 purchased new 2006. Piano has been scrumptiously maintained. Has had light use. Hammers are in terrific condition. Cabinet is unmarred. Tuning pins are tight. String wire is shiny. Has been kept in a very stable environment with proper humidity.This instrument may have an obscure brand, but the company has had a rich history as a piano of choice to Chopin, Debussy, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Ravel, de Falla and Stravinsky. Many famous piano instructors also chose Pleyel \u2013 read about in the Wikipedia. Pleyels rise above the other mass-produced pianos like Yamaha, Kawai and Petrof. They are more comparable to Schimmel. As they are not produced in great volume, the construction is more crafted. If you read the piano forums, folks tend to come back and purchase the Pleyel. They really do stand out above others.\u2022\tConsistent quality\u2022\tSweet sound and powerful bass section\u2022\tExcellent dynamic abilities and possesses a sostenuto pedal! This indicates the type musician the designers         had in mind for this instrument: accomplished.\u2022\tRenner action including hammers special to this piano\u2022\tAction touch is slightly lighter than average\u2022\tVery robust frame (piano weighs over 600 lbs)\u2022\tGorgeous wood graining and finish. Top notch.Recommend you play the Kawai, Yamaha, etc. first and then try this instrument. It is likely your last stop! There are extremely few that are being sold used. Most musicians keep them once acquired."
