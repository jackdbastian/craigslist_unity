It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

                "description": "This is a vintage, men's XL classic bomber jacket from Pendleton. I believe the collar tag is a 1960s design, however I could be mistaken. It is in good, previously owned condition with some flaws as circled in the photos. There are some black marks on the chest and sleeves. The sleeves also have a few tiny threadbare spots as does the back right in the middle. The hem does have some piling. The chest measures approximately 24 across (48 all around) and shoulder to hem length is 27.------Please call/text   or email anytime. Pickup in Rohnert Park.Cash or Venmo accepted.

                "description": "This is a vintage women's jacket by Dallara. Dallara is an Italian racecar manufacturer and these jackets were made with racing enthusiasts in mind. It is fully lined, buttons up, has a removable belt with 4 exterior and 1 interior heart-shaped pockets. This is previously owned and worn, which is evident in the photos, however the leather is so supple and buttery soft, you'll forget about the signs of wear and overstretched-button holes. The lining has an iridescent sheen that shifts from a light forest green to a golden tan. 1 of the small plastic buttons inside has come off but it will be sent with an extra exterior button. There are no size or material tags. From the measurements, I believe this is a women's small or small/medium. Underarm-underarm is approximately 18 across, no stretch (36 around), shoulder seam to sleeve hem is 22, and shoulder to hem length is 31.------Please call/text   or email anytime.

Car already has new the steel gear box which replaced by dealer under TSB 08-003-21,  huge improvement on handling.  I purchased Mopar Max Care warranty plan,  it will last until 5/5/2025 or 60,000 miles.  That\u2019s another four years bumper to bumper warranty,  it should be transferable.   The windshield is crack now but I will have it fix before the sale.  Kbb private party average price is $48000 without all the upgrade.  With the upgrade it should be priced $59000 without the Mopar max care.   What I am asking is very reasonable.  Please contact me only when you are ready to buy.  I am not rushing to sell it.

It features an ultralight cabinet, 4-band EQ, a footswitchable overdrive channel (excellent overdrive btw,) an fx loop, XLR out, headphone out (silences the speaker when connected,) and three additional switches to further sculpt your tone.It has it all, and at only 22 lbs it's the perfect amp for your average bar/club gig. Plenty loud. I saw a friend's band play with one, unmic'd, didn't even use the DI out, and it filled the room quite nicely. It's what made me want to get one. Mine has never been gigged though.Email me with any questions. I accept cash, Venmo, and PayPal. Thanks!"

                "description": "Selling a mint-condition MXR CSP102SL Script Dyna Comp Reissue pedal in original box. This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades. Will accept cash, PayPal, or Venmo. Local buyers only. Good luck"
