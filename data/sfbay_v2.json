Now I have a Kemper and don't need any pedals.Vintage to Modern British Tones in a BoxThe Bogner La Grange overdrive/boost guitar effects pedal gives you a highly tweakable amp-in-a-box that nails the aggressive tones of late '60s British amp stacks. A standard set of controls starts the process for that famous Brown Sound while a row of mini-toggles further allow you to dial the La Grange into your ideal tone. A variable boost function is independently selectable to drive the pedal even harder. And the Bogner La Grange even boasts an expression pedal jack to control your gain levels on the fly.British rock tones from the '60s to todayBogner engineered the La Grange to achieve are some of the most important tones in the history of rock 'n' roll and electric guitar. The amps responsible for these tones were originally seen backing up players as legendary as Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Billy Gibbons, and many, many more. Coming from the Bogner lineage of the Shiva, Ecstasy, and Helios amp heads, the La Grange overdrive pedal easily achieves these cutting, midrange-heavy tones, while adding a range that will deliver the tight, high-gain tones of today.Wide-ranging tonal controlWhat sets the La Grange overdrive/boost effects pedal apart is the amazing amount of flexibility that Bogner packed into its rugged metal housing. The pedal's main controls include your standard volume, gain, and tone controls. But features such as a channel blend that simulates jumping the channels on an old Plexi, variac and structure switches that change the headroom and response of the pedal, and an expression pedal jack for real time gain control make the La Grange more than a one trick pony. Your ideal British rock tone may just be waiting inside this pedal.Independent variable boostOne of the most powerful additions to the Bogner La Grange is the independently selectable boost. The onboard boost is completely variable, allowing you to push the pedal as hard as you'd like for even more saturation and harmonic content. And the boost can be used either with the main circuitry of the La Grange or by itself for punching the front end of your amplifier. This is a huge plus to Sweetwater guitarists for either a volume increase or to get more overdrive from their amp's dirty tones.Bogner La Grange Overdrive/boost Effects Pedal Features:    British rock tone amp-in-a-box overdrive pedal    Channel blend control simulates jumping the channels of the vintage amps    Controls for gain, variac, structure, and presence fine tune the pedal's performance    Individually selectable boost is 100% variable    True bypass won't color your tone when not engaged"
