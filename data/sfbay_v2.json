                "description": "Navajo Concho Shadowbox Linked Sterling Silver Coral Bear Claw Belt Or Necklace Signed TN  for Thomas Nez.  Has oval cut cabochons.  I used to have a southwest retail store in the 1980's that focused on only Native American jewelry, rugs and pottery. I closed this store in 1995. I personally went to New Mexico to work with the Native American Indians, Navajo and Zuni to buy for my shop. So this belt necklace is vintage but new.From Navajo silversmith Thomas Nez, this is a versatile jewelry accessory with a great design that will get noticed! The piece consists of 22 sterling silver bear paw shadow box links. In the center of each shadowbox is a saw tooth bezel set oval coral cabochon. The top of the links are polished shiny, the inside of the shadowbox has an oxidized finish. The links measure 1 1/8\u201d long by 3/4\u201d high. The length is adjustable up to 37\u201d, allowing the piece to be worn as a longer necklace or a belt. The closure is a hook and eye. The back of one of the links is marked STERLING TN.  Please note that if worn as a belt, it is suggested that it is worn for decoration purposes only as the links are not big or heavy. To dress up your favorite plain sweater or to accessorize your blue jeans, either way you wear it, it looks great! This  belt is quintessential of the Southwest Style. Features a hand tooled Bear Paw pattern with a center coral stone increasing this belt's versatility and value. Remember with shadow boxing design there are two layers of sterling silver on EACH concho making it more valuable.If interested call or text Rebecca at  .  I live in a smoke and pet free environment.  CASH ONLY"

Due to not working because of the COVID virus  I haven\u2019t the money to fix it.  It is a federal truck and does not need the catalytic converter a sticker on the air filter makes this possible. The truck was a city truck from the city of Concord and serviced in a schedule. The price is as it Is due to fast sale.   Call for appointment to view. Bob"

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5250 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

When you buy from Keith Holland Guitars, you can rest assured that you're in good hands and that your instrument will be ready to play out of the box.Finnegan's Wake:Ever since Bill Finnegan created the Klon in the early 90's, pedal makers have been scrambling to replicate the magical clear transparent overdrive effect made famous by the pedal. Often imitated and rarely equaled, the Klon remains one of the most talked about pedals of all time. A shroud of mystery continually to surrounds the infamous overdrive. Many strong words have been exchanged between pedal builders, armchair scholars and professional musicians, who spend countless hours a discussing (or debating) just what particular component makes the pedal so good. The black goop, an epoxy resin that obscures the pedal's circuit, only adds to the mystery.All hype aside, its really a great sounding pedal. Its simple, easy to use and extremely versatile. It can act as a simple clean boost or used to get more dirt into your sound. It is a worthwhile investment for someone with a great sounding amp who would like to push it into overdrive territory without losing the natural tone of the amp and guitar. This specific Klon has the Horsie decal and a really low serial # at 492This particular pedal is in Good Condition. There is some scratching and wear to the front and sides of the enclosure and substantial scratching to the bottom. It has been lovingly used and studied by its two principal owners and has been in and around our store's possession ever since Keith was a dealer back in the day."
