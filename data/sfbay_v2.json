                "description": "ALL tube amps were built to be serviced every 10-15 years. If a vintage amp hasn't been serviced since it was new, it's time. Or if it's just making too much noise I can fix that too. There is no reason an old Fender can't run stone quiet if serviced properly and fixed in the traditional fashion with the right parts. Specializing in vintage amps, I service them the way that preserves value and maximizes tone. If your amp is 40 or 50 years old, there is no reason it can't run another 40 or 50 years. If it worked right once, it can work right again.If your vintage amp is needed to gig regularly and provide your income, I can also skip some of the vintage schtick and make it bulletproof with all new parts. That's up to you.If you have a re-issue I'm also happy to take a look. Lots can be done to help a printed circuit board amp sound better, or just be serviced as all tube amps routinely require. However, unlike a vintage amp that can be fixed even if it's blown to bits, fixing a blown to bits printed circuit board is usually not worth it. General Prices Vintage Amps (handwired)-Basic service of 40 watts or lower amp is $125+cost of parts-Above 40 watts $180+ cost of parts-Add $40 to above prices for printed circuit board amps.(Some prices may vary slightly for odd situations)If your old Fender needs more than basic service, like the board is conductive or has moisture damage, a full re-build/refurbish can cost you, but it's well worth preserving the old parts if they can be salvaged and still sound great. Don't let some tech tell you ALL the caps are bad or ALL the tubes are bad. Usually not the case, that is a bunch of malarky techs use to make money. This is a side gig for me, I don't need to eek out another 100$ to eat.Services include;Voicing the ampTube socketsElectrolytic capsBad pots fixed or replacedReverbNo signal/No soundTransformer replacement3 prong cord changed (at your discretion)Tubes tested and replaced where needed (usually not all of them need it)Speaker swapsBad JacksMany other repairs...What makes me different;1. I didn't learn this on the internet, where more than half the information out there is just silly folklore.2. I do this because I love it. I have a real job, and don't NEED to do it.3. I'm a musician, and I can hear a lot of nuance that a plain old electrician can't. I know what TONE is. I'm willing to listen to your tone as well, and help you find your own tonal nirvana. 4. Although I'm not above doing mods, if your amp has been modded to kingdom come over many years, you may find putting it back to original stock sounds better. 95% of the time, that's just how it is. I love putting a chop job back to stock and blowing it's owner's mind.5. I don't mark up parts. I only charge cost for parts. For new tubes, given their fickle nature I provide you with direct sources. That way if there is an issue with a defective new tube you can deal directly with the seller for a replacement. I'll be happy to re-bias the amp at no charge after new tubes get replaced should that be the case.I have a very large assortment of vintage tubes if you would like to roll a few through your amp for some different tones. No problem. My location allows you to play as loud as you want.I stand behind all my work and any vintage tubes for 90 days, sometimes more if a minor previously undetected issue arises. Send me any questions. I can take emergency cases if I'm available for a small rush fee.

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades.

If you are serious about owning a vintage Hammond, it may be worth the trip for this one.The D-152 is electrically the same as a Hammond B-3.  The difference is that the D-100 series have a built-in amplifier, speakers, and reverb. \u00a0There are adapters available to hook it up to a Leslie, or you could make your own connections.It has the famous Hammond B-3 percussion, the same slide bars, same keyboard, the same pre-sets.Mine has a serial number of 2427, probably manufactured in 1967-1968. \u00a0Originally sold in Eureka, CA.It is over 50 years old, and everything functions. Could use cleaning and up-dating, of course. \u00a0The B-3 percussion sounds great. \u00a0Has a small amount of hum at the loud settings, possibly a pre-amp tube.Has two 12 speakers and two 8 speakers.It is missing the bass pedals. \u00a0The cabinet is in decent condition for its age -- still has a good polish, but does have a few scrapes on the corners.Includes a new unopened bottle of Hammond oil. \u00a0The instructions for modifying the presets are inside, as well as the original cloth bag of extra preset screws. \u00a0(See photos)This would be ideal for someone who wants to make a cut-down portable Hammond B3.Any questions please write. \u00a0Cash, no trades. In Arcata. \u00a0------------------------------------------------Here are some Internet links and info:http://www.tonewheelgeneral.com/agelist/agelist.php \u00a0https://ethw.org/Hammond_B3_Organ \u00a0The B3, C3, A100, A105, RT-3, and D-152 all had the same electronics that produced the famed B-3 sound.The same vibrato, chorus, and 2nd & 3rd harmonic percussion.Model B3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1975)Model B2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from December 1949 through December 1954)Model C3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1975)Model A100 Series \u00a0 (Manufactured from ~1959 through 1965)Note: \u00a0 Model A105 continued to be manufactured until January/February 1975.Model RT3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from January 1955 through 1974)Model D100 series \u00a0 \u00a0(Manufactured from July 1963 through September 1969)The Cadillac of Hammonds.
