Includes power cable and foot switch for changing to the overdrive channel. This amp head is $100 for itself, or $125 with the cabinet.Please note the following:-Only the clean channel currently works, and *not* the overdrive channel (which is why this unit is priced so low, usually goes for $180 and up). This can likely be fixed, but using the clean channel through a dedicated effects pedal is often preferable anyway, and the gain on the clean channel delivers a good crunch unto itself.-The \u201cMarshall\u201d logo on the front was lost some time ago, and replaced via hot glue with plastic fridge magnets spelling \u201cFender\u201d. These can probably be removed, but I haven\u2019t tried.I also have a no-name speaker cabinet, shown here, for sale at $50 itself or together with the Marshall amp head for $125. The two 12\u201d speakers in the cabinet are also no-name but loud, and this combo is great for gigging up to mid-size venues. The cabinet dimensions are 30 high x 24 wide x 14 deep."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "FOR SALE: SISTRUM MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, $60.  Replica of an ancient Sistrum (rattle).  These were used as musical percussion instruments for various rites and ceremonies.  The Sistrum first appeared in the Old Kingdom and became connected to the goddesses Isis and Hathor.  Unfortunately very few exist.  Most of the surviving ones come from the Greco-Roman era.  It\u2019s closest modern equivalent is the tambourine and is used the same way.   The Sistrum has a long handle, a frame with crossbars and small disks that rattle when shaken.  They were made of wood, stone or metal.  The word Sistrum means that which is being shaken.  The Egyptians believed that the Sistrum had magical properties. It is connected with the powers of the Goddess and symbolizes joy, fertility and eroticism.  It was believed that the Sistrum could avert the flooding of the Nile.  One of the most famous depictions of the Sistrum is in the Hathor Temple in Dendera.  You will also see depictions of the Goddess Isis with a symbol of inundation in one hand and a Sistrum in the other. All vintage, antique and used items are sold \u201cas found\u201d and are priced accordingly."
