Based on labels and family history we're guessing these pants are from the 1963-1966 period. If so, considering their age, these are in VERY GOOD condition.Size: 33 & Long per inside labels. Using a tailor's tape they measure 33 inside the waistband, before any adjusting of the waistbands, HOWEVER... as someone that wears 33-34 inch waist pants these ski pants are truly for someone with a 28-31-inch waist. Length is 33-34 by measurement and trying on. Rise is 10-11.Source: Made in West GermanyMaterial: Wool 58%, Nylon 38%, Spandex 4%Condition Note: Generally excellent condition with exception of 2 small holes near by left front pocket.Styling: Fly zipper + 3 zippered pocket. All zippers work. Iconic metal B pull tabs on 3 pocket-zippers all present. ............. 2 metal hook and eye's front waistband closure above zipper fly.............. 2 Button waistband expansion belts on both sides. .............

No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"

It sounds AMAZING! Very little damage overall, with the only really noticeable aspects being very small tears in the speaker cover.

Previously owner was the original owner and hardly played it, and (shame on me) neither did I, the second owner. My teacher is most famous as a timbales player, so I wanted to take it up. But I realize now that I don't have the bandwidth to pick it up while also learning bongos and congas (not to mention guitar, woodwinds, harmonica...I have a lot of interests!). And now I need to collect funds for a recent surgery. Hence the reluctant sale!Everything is from JCR, except the Bullfrog block (which came with the set when I bought it) and the LP cha-cha bell (which I bought new). Set also comes with the JCR stand, and a couple of non-JCR bags which don't look like they were necessarily for timbales, but they do the job. JCR, the man and master maker, is no longer with us on earth. And neither is his company. So no more JCR timbales are being made. It's hard enough to find one for sale. From what I see online, this is one of the few left in the world in this kind of excellent condition available for sale!"

                "description": "Really doin't want to sell this guy, but my loss is your gain. No low ballers or trade offers pleaseWhat is the Acidbox lll? --> Erica Synths Acidbox III brings you the core of the famous Polivoks VCF in stereo version with a unique audio signal overdrive circuit, built in LFO and envelope follower in a compact, full aluminium case. Features Polivoks core stereo lowpass/bandpass VCF with the original programmable opamps Unique audio overdrive circuit Versatile syncable LFO with 8 waveforms Tap tempo button Envelope follower with modulation level attenuverter Master modulation control Manual and CV control over cutoff frequency Configurable control input for footswitch, expression pedal and external LFO/cutoff control Adjustable input gain The Acidbox III has adjustable input gain, therefore it works with various sound sources \u2013 guitars, units with line level signals (synthesizers, grooveboxes, etc.) and modular synths. Configurable control input allows you to connect a bypass footswitch, expression pedal, external cutoff control voltage source and LFO synchronization trigger. This makes the Acidbox an ideal companion in almost every production or live performance setup. A characterful, gritty analogue effect, made all the more flexible by its stereo signal path and modulation options. -Future Music Magazinelists Acidbox III among the best new studio gear of 2018 The acidbox III should appeal to many, thanks to its flexibility. On the most basic of levels, the stereo I/O makes it a perfect addition to a DJ rig, where real-time filtering is easy to control and trip in and out, thanks to the Bypass switch. The envelope follower will appeal to live musicians and there is nothing to stop users from using pedals to control elements such as Bypass on the fly. The Polivoks filter is characterful, with tons of charm, but very dirty with it \u2013 and as a useful colour in a number of settings, this could become a very valuable piece of kit for both live and studio work. - MusicTech Magazine rates Acidbox III 9 out of 10! Erica Synths has finally made the Acidbox' third generation - stereo capable and thus hits the bull's eye. Now it can be applied to all types of signals: for flat mono synths, as a strong character filter or as a special effect in the DJ Booth. On top of that, guitarists and bass players can hook up their instruments and indulge in the funk creating by Envelope Follower shaping the input signal. The Acidbox III can also sound warm, but if you're looking for a comforting soft filter then you should look elsewhere. The Acidbox III sounds confidently different and immediately delivers inspiring results.tags: #moog #oberheim #waldorf #Boss #Pioneer #Yamaha #Roland #Korg #Meris #Strymon #Eurorack #EHX #DeathByAudio"

All the classic Roland kits and then some...building custom kits is easy and fun with my own sounds.What is the TR-8S? --> Born of the most famous and influential drum machines ever made, the TR-8S combines the best of its Roland heritage with modern production techniques and professional sound design. The result? A forward-thinking, performance-tuned instrument unlike any other. Build your dream kit from the most iconic drum sounds of all time, plus the finest selection of stereo samples from a vast sound library -- or import your own custom samples. Tap, tune and tweak with hands-on controls and production tools that make your patterns move and groove. And why keep this kind of percussive power confined to the studio? The TR-8S was literally made to play live.Transistor RhythmsThe TR-8S has every sound from the most sought-after TR drum machines, with detailed circuit-models of the 808, 606, 909, 707, 727, 626 and even several modified versions. These are not sound-alike sample-packs or mere recordings of TR drum sounds. Each machine is a detailed, down-to-the-circuit-model that sounds and behaves exactly like the original hardware. All these sounds are yours, at your fingertips, and ready to use in your own productions and performances.#Roland #Korg #Moog #DaveSmith #Arturia #Eurorack"
