Beautiful beading and lace embellishments. Unfortunately, altering this dress to fit me (I'm Size 0) turned out to be *way* more expensive than I was led to believe by the bridal shop. Hence me buying another dress in my size and selling this one.This bridal dress is brand new. While I bought it on sale, the original price was over $1,600. Asking $299 OBO."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most solid-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Keeley 30ms Automatic Double Tracker Features:Double Tracking Effect Slap Back ReverbStudio Two Chamber ReverbTrue Stereo ChorusThe stereo effect pedal offers an array of studio style doubling effects used for creating thicker, fuller sounding instruments.  Also included in the effect pedal is a reverb that simulates the famous chamber in Studio Two. The Keeley 30ms is designed to work with guitar, bass, keyboard, even vocals\u201cSince the early days of automatic double tracking pioneered by Ken Townsend and John Lennon at Abbey Road Studios, this technique has become the de facto way of creating recordings that sound bigger and fuller by making it sound like two guitars, or singers, or instrumentalists are playing at same time,\u201d said chief engineer Robert Keeley. \u201cThe Keeley 30ms Automatic Double Tracker offers musicians the ability to take these techniques with them out on the road with a wide range of tools needed for crafting unique double tracking schemes.\u201dThe Keeley Engineering 30ms Automatic Double Tracker pedal can be used in mono with a built in \u201cAbbey Verb\u201d reverb control, or in stereo as the Double Tracker Pro. The 30ms offers altered and detuned effects like a chorus pedal might sound, only without the regularity of a LFO oscillator in Dimension Mode. In this mode you have the ability to create up to two different voices for a stereo double tracked field. The user controls the tuning and delay for results that are stunning mono or through two amplifiers in stereo. Abbey Mode offers something more similar to a conventional chorus in that it simulates synched tape decks running in parallel with varying tape speeds. Stereo or mono this mode gives players a wide, lush sound without sounding like a conventional chorus pedal. Lastly the team at Keeley created a unique Slapback Mode for rockabilly sounds. The Slapback is now a double tracked echo with the two altered voices. Add the Keeley Abbey Verb to this mode to create really new effects.In Stereo Double Tracker Pro mode the unit drops the reverb channel in favor of complete control over the double tracked voices. Each of the two voices can be tuned up to 30 cents sharp and flat. Those voices are then delayed by up to 30 milliseconds for subtle to very distinctive doubling sounds. The user can program by internal switches the wet output to have either dry and effected sounds, or just the effect, giving them true double tracking in stereo, live."
