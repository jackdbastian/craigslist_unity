Purchased used, in new condition, in 2012.  Was in home studio (no smokin) service until 2016.  In storage since.A scan from the owners manual, displayed here, shows how Mackie defines it as a 12 channel mixer.Includes padded Gig Skinz carry bag and Mackie dust cover.Includes optional 96kHz FireWire card that was originally available for streaming 14 independent channels of audio to computer.  Since Mackie stopped supporting drivers, it may or may NOT have that functionality on a Mac.  Definitely not on a Windows platform as of the last time I contacted Mackie in 2016.From Mackie: The Mackie Onyx 1220 12-Channel Mixer is a small-format analog mixer. Includes 4 boutique-class Onyx mic preamps with 3-band Perkins EQ plus sweepable mids on mic/line channels. . . .Includes aux sends with pre/post switches, 4 stereo line-level inputs, a talkback section for use with internal or external mics, true hardware EQ bypass, and a Planet-Earth switching power supply for worldwide use.

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

Cabinet is unmarred. Tuning pins are tight. String wire is shiny. Has been kept in a very stable environment with proper humidity.This instrument may have an obscure brand, but the company has had a rich history as a piano of choice to Chopin, Debussy, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Ravel, de Falla and Stravinsky. Many famous piano instructors also chose Pleyel \u2013 read about in the Wikipedia. Pleyels rise above the other mass-produced pianos like Yamaha, Kawai and Petrof. They are more comparable to Schimmel. As they are not produced in great volume, the construction is more crafted. If you read the piano forums, folks tend to come back and purchase the Pleyel. They really do stand out above others.\u2022\tConsistent quality\u2022\tSweet sound and powerful bass section\u2022\tExcellent dynamic ability\u2022\tRenner action including hammers special to this piano\u2022\tAction touch is slightly lighter than average\u2022\tVery robust frame (piano weighs over 600 lbs)\u2022\tGorgeous wood graining and finish. Top notch.Recommend you play the Kawai, Yamaha, etc. first and then try this instrument. It is likely your last stop! There are extremely few that are being sold used. Most musicians keep them once acquired."

                "description": "The Yamaha YBS-52 is the little brother to the famous YBS-62 .It's not the most expensive bari sax but it is the most popular bari sax made today . It is recommended by just about every saxophone teacher .It gives you the most bang for the buck . It is thousands of dollars cheaper than the 62 but has has exactly the same scale and key work with the exception of no high F# key ( but who needs it ! )Bari saxes in general tend to get pretty beat up . It's a big instrument . This one is in above average condition . There are signs of some dent removal but it is nice and straight with good lacquer.It has had all dents taken out , lacquer touched up , body joint sealed , re assembled and regulated .It plays great and has a real BARK to the bottom end .This is a later upgraded model withe tilting low Bb touchThe original case is in good  condition . The case sometimes takes more of a beating than the sax .retail price is over $8000 , internet price is around $5600 . Save yourself a couple of thousand dollars and get a bari that plays as good as new if not better.It comes with everything needed to play it . . I also have bari's below this one .  As far as I can see it is the only nice used one around for sale !Only e-mails with ph # will be replied to"
