It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

They are just a couple of years old, sealed, and thus as good as new.These are no longer made so are hard to find. Martin was using Cleartone for the coating at this point, but since then they have formulated their own in-house coating which they now call Lifespan 2.0. I have not tried those strings so do not know how they compare. Perhaps because no licensing fees are involved, they are a bit cheaper.These sold for $19 each and sets of 3 would typically go for over $40. I scoured a site named after a famous Brasilian river to get an idea of what a fair price would be. The posted price is for three sets as it is an unopened box."

                "description": "1930s Oscar Schmidt stencil guitar featuring a Hawaiian scene.Solid birch\u2014the shape and silhouette is quite like their famous Stella. It has that deep, satisfying sound too.There are some repaired cracks along the upper bout, scuffs and stencil discoloring, but generally the guitar is in great shape. Stamped on the top of the headstock is \u201cFATDOG 93.\u201dGoing with the theme, I have set this up, with a vintage nut riser, to be played lap style like a Hawaiian guitar.Without the nut extender the relatively high action measures 1/16\u201d at first fret, 2/16\u201d at seventh fret and 3/16\u201d at twelfth fret (see last photos).In all, an enjoyable guitar - both visually and sonically - that is a playable work of art.NEW gig bag included (not shown).Local pick up only; CASH ONLY."
