Reducing the carbon footprint of society by recycling usable bay area trees. Keeping these beautiful specimens out of the landfills helps combat massive sequestered carbon entering our atmosphere.

This is why we call these \u201csecond life logs\u201d .We are addicted to STACKING!We have hundreds of live edge wood slabs available SML, MED, LRG, XL, & XXL sizes. Our  Bay area & Sonoma County inventory is constantly changing!

We can walk you through the entire process. First timers no need to be anxious, this is supposed to be FUN. The #1 comment customers say is \u201cWow it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought, I\u2019m glad you told me to try it\u201d   We aren\u2019t in the furniture business. We are in the heirloom conversation piece business. Each and every wood slab is unique in it\u2019s own way. Our job is complete when we here a \u201cbing\u201d and see a photo come through of you standing proudly by your masterpiece. We don\u2019t call it quits when you drive away from our facility.  My heart is full of gratitude as I continue reflect on the salvaged material we have provided to our customers over the years. Thank you to everyone that has consciously chosen to purchase the foundation of their project from us . My partners and I invest so much heart into recycling mother nature\u2019s artwork and it is an indescribable feeling to have you guys recognize both the beauty and the effort put forth to give these logs a second life. It is so special for us to be a part of your story. Making the decision to spend your hard earned money on something we worked tirelessly to provide is not something we take lightly or for granted. We appreciate you! STACK EM\u2019 UP!!-Eric Christopher                            Process1. Decide on a project2. Measure the designated available space, keeping in mind the sizes of other nearby objects. Keeping things proportional will help your space feel sophisticated & curated rather than out of place or overbearing.3. Come Look! The fun begins here! Everyone\u2019s taste is different so it\u2019s best to complete steps 1 & 2 and then come look at our inventory and see if anything screams \u201cTake me home\u201d Our inventory is constantly changing. I tell customers \u201cour store is like a shoe store. We don\u2019t always have every size/model/color but it might be tomorrow that we bring the desired material in. Our inventory is based on the trees we are able to give a second life to, not the \u201cclick of a button\u201d reorder.4. Price is based on many factors as each boule is unique in it\u2019s own way and each boule is in a different state of its life. The main factors we consider are:-Size (board foot aka volume of material)-Species -Figure-Moisture content-Raw or SurfacedOnce Home 1. Decide on the aesthetic look you want to achieve. Do you want the piece to be rustic or lean towards a clean \u201cscuplted\u201d look?2.Remove the bark. We like to use a \u201ccats paw\u201d and a mallet, working pieces off as large as possible. For hardwoods a draw knife works well.3.Sand, scuplt, and clean-up the edges (if that follows suit towards your desired look. ) If a rustic look is desired you may wish to leave the edge as is.  4.Sand the top & bottom. We generally start at 60 grit, working our way through the grits until at least 400 grit. THIS IS NOT a requirement, just our preference. The higher grits do not only make the wood fibers smoother, they allow the true beauty of the wood to expose itself. The 3D figure is more pronounced and shows a higher level of visual contrast. Some figured woods we sand 1200+ grit. THE FINISH YOU CHOOSE MAY DICTATE WHAT GRIT YOU STOP SANDING AT. Some finish brands call for designated end points wich are usually lower in grit than our preference of 400 grit. Many require a max of 220 grit. Read manufactures directions to see if they specify. Once sanded up to 100 grit we like to then cut ends to size if needed, then continue sanding working our way up through the grits. We sand a bit before cutting to size because it makes for less friction on the saw, which usually helps make a smooth, clean cut.We blow off the slab with compressed air and wipe the entire slab with a tac cloth to remove loose dust, prepping the slab for its finish stage.Choosing a finish.Customers always ask what finish I recommend for their project. My answer: finishing is a riddle only you can solve, knowing what you want it to look like, and howmuch time + money do you want to invest. There is not one does-all finish that I recommend for everyone because each finish has it\u2019s pros and cons and everyone has a different vision of how they want their heirloom to look. I will list several of the common types of finishes and the pros and cons as I see it through my experience. Penetrating Oil - UV StabilizedPros Easy application, very quick rich results showing a high percentage of the figure within the wood, sophisticated matte sheen, Inexpensive, easy touch up maintenance, penetrates fibers deep within the wood protecting integrity, UV sun rays do minimal degradation.Cons Not a developed surface finish. This means spills such as red wine will not be stopped from entering the pores of the wood.2 Part EpoxyPros Shows all hidden figure within the wood. The \u201ctruth serum\u201d for wood. Hard surface, fast build up, strengthens any pith , fills checking, and hardens softwoods. A \u201c5 in 1\u201d type of finish. 4 coats of epoxy is similar to 40 coats of polyurethane.Cons Glossy, less margin for error. generally low UV stabilization, many brands yellow over time when outside in sunlight Polyurethane - Water basedPros Easy clean up,Fast drying, Easy \u201cpowdering up\u201d sanding. Dries faster than oil based polyurethane and can be heavier coats too. Barrier to moisture and spills. Many available sheens- gloss, semigloss, satin, flat, and matte.Cons Not as rich as an oil or an epoxy, more bland. A developed finish is slow building. Each coat takes several hrs to dry and many coats are generally needed to have a \u201cmarble like\u201dend result.Polyurethane - Oil BasedPros Rich, deep coloring . High levels of contrast. Durable. Barrier to moisture and spills. Many available sheens- gloss, semigloss, satin, flat, and matte. Many UV stabilized versions available.Cons Intense fumes, stickier clean up, respirator required , tacky feel compared to water based. Slow building, cannot lay heavy coats. Heavy coating runs risk of \u201cskin over\u201d. The top surface dries, creating a thin layer preventing the off gasing process and leaving a sticky, tacky finish that will never properly dry and cure.Contactphone  Website: www.EricChristopherArt.comemail Eric@ErichChristopherArtFb @EricChristopherArtIg @EricChristopherArt5325 Gravenstein Highway NorthSebastopol, CA 95472Business HoursMon:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMTue:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMWed:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMThu:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMFri:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMSat:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMSun:\t9:00 AM \u2013 4:00 PM"

In 1990 I attended a church charity event in San Bruno, Ca and these gloves were one of the bidding items. There was a bidding war with about 6 of us, however the reserve was not met and these gloves were not sold. They were held for the next years charity event. In 1991 I again attended this event.  These gloves were once again on the block. There was another bidding war with approx. 6-10 others. I won the bid and my cost was $425.00, however that was only for charity. The entire time they have been in a vented box, climate house and never put on. Both are in pristine, brand new unblemished condition. At the time of win/sale (1991) I was given a professional document of authenticity from the church with dates, serial number etc. At one point I put it in our safety deposit box, then there was a move to another bank box. At this point we can't find the document in our files. I have contacted the church. It's been 30 years and this church no longer puts on these sport type of charitable events. We wrote to the George Foreman's Offical web site. We are waiting for a response back. I have no idea what these are worth, however a George Foreman fan should have them.... $75.00........Thank you"

                "description": "Blackstar ID:260 TVP2x12, 60WCondition: goodIncludes footswitch (typically sold separately. retail: $99)This is a great sounding and loud amp, loaded with all the effects you can think of. You can really dial in almost any tone you're looking for with the TVP (True Valve Power--allows you to shape your tone based on highly accurate power tube models) and ISF (Infinite Shape Feature--allows you to choose between American and British mid-range tones)  controls. DISCLOSURE: There is a crack in the cabinet (see last pic). This is due to Guitar Center not knowing how to pack a heavy amp for shipping. However, this crack does not affect the tone or function of the amp. In terms of structural integrity, the cabinet still feels VERY SOLID, as the crack does not move nor do any of the cabinet panels. If it were not for this crack, this amp would be considered to be in EXCELLENT condition.REASON FOR SELLING: I'm more into floor-based amp modelers/effect processors, e.g. Headrush, Line 6, etc. these days. And I'm moving so it's time to clean out the garage.Feel free to reach out with any questions or to schedule a time if you'd like to come by and check it out."

No internal mods Looks to be all stock .I've read some ibfo on these amps that discusses bleed over from channel 1 (clean) . I have not experienced this or noticed.The 1st channel is sparkling clean , Channel 2 is classic marshall crunch . reverb on both channels . & don't let the size fool ya , its plenty loud . Run through a 4x12 and it sounds huge . 4,8&16 ohms switching. Original Footswitch included $900 !! not looking for trades thanks"

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

Not to be mistaken with the Octavian (with a N at the end) which while I understand is same circuit but cuts some corners on the quality of some of its parts.   Famous guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Baughan, and Tony Iommi have been known to use the original Tycobrahe Octavia.I have a like-new one in box with all box candy included.  Not a scratch on this pedal."
