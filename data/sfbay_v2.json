The length is floor length for someone who is ~5' 9 - 5' 10 with no heels (I am 5' 2 and wore 6 heels and it was still a bit long) so could work for a variety of heights as-is depending on your heel height.Retail price: $16,000, still have the original tagSell price: $1500, cash, Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle onlySilhouette: A-lineNeckline: Strapless (Straight Across)Waistline: Natural WaistSleeve Style: StraplessBack Style: Mid BackDress Length: Floor LengthThe dress is an ivory color, with three-dimensional flowers and intricate beaded vines. There is a built-in corset and the dress is extremely flattering thanks to the corset plus the high quality fabric. This dress has been worn once for a wedding and has been cleaned, there are minor dirt marks at the bottom but these are only noticeable upon close inspection and this part can be cut off if hemming the dress shorter (dress is at almost original length which is very long). Dress has a bustle added already.Serious buyers only, if this listing is still up, the dress is still available.Search \u201cpavirtualgaragesale\u201d for more items."

This would also be a great investment unlike a new sax that would depreciate in value.This sax plays nice and has that tone the Mark VI is famous for. Original finish but does show slight wear, but very nice for it\u2019s age. No dents & the serial numbers do match, and the original case is in very good condition. Please email with any questions."

It's in like-new condition with all original packaging (box, Danelectro branded leather pouch, documentation, protective foam.)This is a two-voice fuzz, based on the Univox/Shin-Ei Super Fuzz with controls for Volume, Gain, Treble, and Bass, plus a switch to go between the fuzz voicings. The second fuzz voice is the famous Electric Wizard tone, though many other classic recordings feature the Superfuzz of yore.Email me with any questions. I accept cash, Venmo, and PayPal. Thanks!"
