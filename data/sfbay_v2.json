                "description": "YES, WE ARE DELIVERING THROUGH THE SHELTER IN PLACE DUE TO THE FACT THAT AGRICULTURAL DELIVERIES ARE EXEMPT. WE WILL NOT COME NEAR YOU PERSONALLY AND RESPECT ALL SOCIAL DISTANCING PRACTICES. BE SAFE AND TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER.Assorted tree chips for garden mulch, weed suppression, dry fill for a muddy horse corral, to keep the dust down on dry roads or dry corrals, or erosion control to keep the local creeks and streams clean and clear.THE PICTURES ARE FOR REPRESENTATION, WE GET ALL TYPES OF MULCH, (NOTHING THAT WOULD HURT HORSES). IF YOU CALL OR EMAIL IN A REQUEST FOR A LOAD, YOU WILL GET WHAT IS NEXT IN THE PILE FOR LOADING. IF YOU WANT SPECIFIC PRODUCT, YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME HERE AND PICK OUT YOUR MULCH. IF YOU DON'T PICK OUT YOUR MULCH PERSONALLY, YOU GET WHAT YOU GET. This is B grade, which means it's assorted tree types, and not screened for size like the more expensive product at the nursery, it will have twigs and leaves. This mulch will work for you the same as the expensive nursery mulch but you will save more than half price.I have a tractor to load your truck or trailer, it's 3-4 buckets to fill up the bed of the average full size truck bed, but I'll measure your bed and tell you how many square yards it will hold, and we'll go from there. THERE IS A $20 MINIMUM CHARGE FOR ME TO USE MY TRACTOR TO LOAD YOUR TRUCK OR TRAILER, TRACTOR CHARGE FOR ANY LOAD OVER 6YDS IS $30. IF YOU'D LIKE TO BRING YOUR OWN SHOVEL, AND LOAD YOUR TRAILER OR TRUCK YOURSELF, THAT IS FINE WITH ME. It's $20 for up to 3 yards, and $6 per yard after that. This is about 1/4 the price of what you'd pay at the landscape yards.***THERE IS $40 MINIMUM, (CHIPS AND LOADING TOTAL), FOR ANY CHIP PICKUP.****If you need a larger quantity than you can transport on your own, I have a trailer I can tow to your house with a dump bed that holds 6 yards. I charge $40 for a full trailer of chips, with a $45 minimum for delivery, (which includes one hour of load time). One load with delivery is $85 if you are local, (Northeast Petaluma, Downtown Penngrove, South Cotati, etc).If you need a lot of chips and would like to talk about having full truck loads brought straight to your property. A full truck load is about 4 trailer loads, but it's the cost of 3 trailer loads, so it's like buying 3 and getting one free. The cost, with delivery, depends on where you are located.IF YOU ARE SHOPPING AROUND WITH OTHER CHIP VENDORS ON CL, MAKE SURE THEY ARE INCLUDING A DUMP TRAILER, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE SHOVELING CHIPS AT YOUR PLACE OUT OF THEIR TRUCK.How much volume can your pickup hold?A full size 3/4 or 1 ton pickup can hold 3 about cubic yards, slightly rounded, but product weight must be considered. Most full size pickups can handle 3 yards of mulch. Never load more than what is reasonable or what your vehicle is specified to carry. A smaller compact pickup will haul about 1/2 what a full size pickup will carry.How much does a yard of product weigh?Weights for our products will vary from winter to summer because of the moisture content in the product. Typically, mulch products will weigh between 500 to 800 lbs. per cubic yard.One cubic yard= (3' x 3' x 3'= 27 cubic feet)Coverage of one cubic yard by inches deep, keep in mind that a full 6 yard load will be 6 times these numbers.1 inch deep covers 324 sq. ft. per yard2 inch deep covers 162 sq. ft. per yard3 inch deep covers 108 sq. ft. per yard4 inch deep covers 81 sq. ft. per yard5 inch deep covers 54 sq. ft. per yardIf you've ever shoveled 6 yards of mulch, you'll find that $40 for not having to shovel out a pick up truck full of mulch is a bargain. Not only will you not have to spend 2 hours to shovel it out of your truck or trailer, but you won't have to pay for the round trip gas in your truck for two or three trips.All and all, a pretty good deal.We work to do our part to responsibly utilize the wood waste and convert it into a usable resource. Many of our customers like this and support the effort by utilizing mulch themselves. Many contractors use this material also for Soil Building & Erosion Control.This product works great for Soil Building, Weed Control, Garden, and all of your Landscaping needs.With the threat of drought up ahead, protect your soil moisture and use mulch to retain moisture around your plants while controlling the spread of Weeds. When you apply mulch it can help retain soil moisture by controlling evaporation of applied water to plants.I have lots of repeat customers, so I must be doing something right.WITH SO MUCH SPAM ON CRAIGSLIST, I'LL ONLY RESPOND TO INQUIRIES WITH A NAME, PHONE NUMBER AND TOWN WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE THE MULCH DELIVERED IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PICK IT UP YOURSELF."

Car already has new the steel gear box which replaced by dealer under TSB 08-003-21,  huge improvement on handling.  I purchased Mopar Max Care warranty plan,  it will last until 5/5/2025 or 60,000 miles.  That\u2019s another four years bumper to bumper warranty,  it should be transferable.   The windshield is crack now but I will have it fix before the sale.  Kbb private party average price is $48000 without all the upgrade.  With the upgrade it should be priced $59000 without the Mopar max care.   What I am asking is very reasonable.  Please contact me only when you are ready to buy.  I am not rushing to sell it.

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

You can really dial in almost any tone you're looking for with the TVP (True Valve Power--allows you to shape your tone based on highly accurate power tube models) and ISF (Infinite Shape Feature--allows you to choose between American and British mid-range tones)  controls. DISCLOSURE: There is a crack in the cabinet (see last pic). This is due to Guitar Center not knowing how to pack a heavy amp for shipping. However, this crack does not affect the tone or function of the amp. In terms of structural integrity, the cabinet still feels VERY SOLID, as the crack does not move nor do any of the cabinet panels. If it were not for this crack, this amp would be considered to be in EXCELLENT condition.REASON FOR SELLING: I'm more into floor-based amp modelers/effect processors, e.g. Headrush, Line 6, etc. these days. And I'm moving so it's time to clean out the garage.Feel free to reach out with any questions or to schedule a time if you'd like to come by and check it out."
