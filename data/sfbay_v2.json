It includes the  taxidermied Lizard Head with stuffed and raised, neck, shoulders, arms and hands. The head and front feet are masterfully sewed on the purse front. It\u2019s really unique.  I can\u2019t find anything like it on the internet. The purse has 3 small pouches inside, and a slot on the outside back. It has a spacious interior and doesn\u2019t appear to have ever been used. It measures 10 \u00bc\u201d wide, 6 \u00be\u201d high (excluding the handle), and 9 \u00bd\u201d (with the handle).  It is in excellent vintage condition.We are downsizing our collections, check out our other postings to see if there are other items of interest.

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5250 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

                "description": "Fully discrete these are famous for their thick and rich tone... great as mic preamps or as a summing unit or as an analog mixer. You just can't get a transformer loaded discrete channel with preamp, line amp, sends and EQ for anywhere near this price.Comes with enough new parts to recap a few channels and you can add more channel strips later if you need more.... they come up on ebay every few weeks or so.The 6 individual strips alone often sell for about 125-150 each plus tax and shipping.  The GA80080 Tamura Output Transformers sell for about 60-65 each."
