Thank you to everyone that has consciously chosen to purchase the foundation of their project from us . My partners and I invest so much heart into recycling mother nature\u2019s artwork and it is an indescribable feeling to have you guys recognize both the beauty and the effort put forth to give these logs a second life. It is so special for us to be a part of your story. Making the decision to spend your hard earned money on something we worked tirelessly to provide is not something we take lightly or for granted. We appreciate you! STACK EM\u2019 UP!!-Eric Christopher                            Process1. Decide on a project2. Measure the designated available space, keeping in mind the sizes of other nearby objects. Keeping things proportional will help your space feel sophisticated & curated rather than out of place or overbearing.3. Come Look! The fun begins here! Everyone\u2019s taste is different so it\u2019s best to complete steps 1 & 2 and then come look at our inventory and see if anything screams \u201cTake me home\u201d Our inventory is constantly changing. I tell customers \u201cour store is like a shoe store. We don\u2019t always have every size/model/color but it might be tomorrow that we bring the desired material in. Our inventory is based on the trees we are able to give a second life to, not the \u201cclick of a button\u201d reorder.4. Price is based on many factors as each boule is unique in it\u2019s own way and each boule is in a different state of its life. The main factors we consider are:-Size (board foot aka volume of material)-Species -Figure-Moisture content-Raw or SurfacedOnce Home 1. Decide on the aesthetic look you want to achieve. Do you want the piece to be rustic or lean towards a clean \u201cscuplted\u201d look?2.Remove the bark. We like to use a \u201ccats paw\u201d and a mallet, working pieces off as large as possible. For hardwoods a draw knife works well.3.Sand, scuplt, and clean-up the edges (if that follows suit towards your desired look. ) If a rustic look is desired you may wish to leave the edge as is.  4.Sand the top & bottom. We generally start at 60 grit, working our way through the grits until at least 400 grit. THIS IS NOT a requirement, just our preference. The higher grits do not only make the wood fibers smoother, they allow the true beauty of the wood to expose itself. The 3D figure is more pronounced and shows a higher level of visual contrast. Some figured woods we sand 1200+ grit. THE FINISH YOU CHOOSE MAY DICTATE WHAT GRIT YOU STOP SANDING AT. Some finish brands call for designated end points wich are usually lower in grit than our preference of 400 grit. Many require a max of 220 grit. Read manufactures directions to see if they specify. Once sanded up to 100 grit we like to then cut ends to size if needed, then continue sanding working our way up through the grits. We sand a bit before cutting to size because it makes for less friction on the saw, which usually helps make a smooth, clean cut.We blow off the slab with compressed air and wipe the entire slab with a tac cloth to remove loose dust, prepping the slab for its finish stage.Choosing a finish.Customers always ask what finish I recommend for their project. My answer: finishing is a riddle only you can solve, knowing what you want it to look like, and howmuch time + money do you want to invest. There is not one does-all finish that I recommend for everyone because each finish has it\u2019s pros and cons and everyone has a different vision of how they want their heirloom to look. I will list several of the common types of finishes and the pros and cons as I see it through my experience. Penetrating Oil - UV StabilizedPros Easy application, very quick rich results showing a high percentage of the figure within the wood, sophisticated matte sheen, Inexpensive, easy touch up maintenance, penetrates fibers deep within the wood protecting integrity, UV sun rays do minimal degradation.Cons Not a developed surface finish. This means spills such as red wine will not be stopped from entering the pores of the wood.2 Part EpoxyPros Shows all hidden figure within the wood. The \u201ctruth serum\u201d for wood. Hard surface, fast build up, strengthens any pith , fills checking, and hardens softwoods. A \u201c5 in 1\u201d type of finish. 4 coats of epoxy is similar to 40 coats of polyurethane.Cons Glossy, less margin for error. generally low UV stabilization, many brands yellow over time when outside in sunlight Polyurethane - Water basedPros Easy clean up,Fast drying, Easy \u201cpowdering up\u201d sanding. Dries faster than oil based polyurethane and can be heavier coats too. Barrier to moisture and spills. Many available sheens- gloss, semigloss, satin, flat, and matte.Cons Not as rich as an oil or an epoxy, more bland. A developed finish is slow building. Each coat takes several hrs to dry and many coats are generally needed to have a \u201cmarble like\u201dend result.Polyurethane - Oil BasedPros Rich, deep coloring . High levels of contrast. Durable. Barrier to moisture and spills. Many available sheens- gloss, semigloss, satin, flat, and matte. Many UV stabilized versions available.Cons Intense fumes, stickier clean up, respirator required , tacky feel compared to water based. Slow building, cannot lay heavy coats. Heavy coating runs risk of \u201cskin over\u201d. The top surface dries, creating a thin layer preventing the off gasing process and leaving a sticky, tacky finish that will never properly dry and cure.Contactphone  Website: www.EricChristopherArt.comemail Eric@ErichChristopherArtFb @EricChristopherArtIg @EricChristopherArt5325 Gravenstein Highway NorthSebastopol, CA 95472Business HoursMon:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMTue:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMWed:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMThu:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMFri:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMSat:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMSun:\t9:00 AM \u2013 4:00 PM"

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most solid-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Keeley 30ms Automatic Double Tracker Features:Double Tracking Effect Slap Back ReverbStudio Two Chamber ReverbTrue Stereo ChorusThe stereo effect pedal offers an array of studio style doubling effects used for creating thicker, fuller sounding instruments.  Also included in the effect pedal is a reverb that simulates the famous chamber in Studio Two. The Keeley 30ms is designed to work with guitar, bass, keyboard, even vocals\u201cSince the early days of automatic double tracking pioneered by Ken Townsend and John Lennon at Abbey Road Studios, this technique has become the de facto way of creating recordings that sound bigger and fuller by making it sound like two guitars, or singers, or instrumentalists are playing at same time,\u201d said chief engineer Robert Keeley. \u201cThe Keeley 30ms Automatic Double Tracker offers musicians the ability to take these techniques with them out on the road with a wide range of tools needed for crafting unique double tracking schemes.\u201dThe Keeley Engineering 30ms Automatic Double Tracker pedal can be used in mono with a built in \u201cAbbey Verb\u201d reverb control, or in stereo as the Double Tracker Pro. The 30ms offers altered and detuned effects like a chorus pedal might sound, only without the regularity of a LFO oscillator in Dimension Mode. In this mode you have the ability to create up to two different voices for a stereo double tracked field. The user controls the tuning and delay for results that are stunning mono or through two amplifiers in stereo. Abbey Mode offers something more similar to a conventional chorus in that it simulates synched tape decks running in parallel with varying tape speeds. Stereo or mono this mode gives players a wide, lush sound without sounding like a conventional chorus pedal. Lastly the team at Keeley created a unique Slapback Mode for rockabilly sounds. The Slapback is now a double tracked echo with the two altered voices. Add the Keeley Abbey Verb to this mode to create really new effects.In Stereo Double Tracker Pro mode the unit drops the reverb channel in favor of complete control over the double tracked voices. Each of the two voices can be tuned up to 30 cents sharp and flat. Those voices are then delayed by up to 30 milliseconds for subtle to very distinctive doubling sounds. The user can program by internal switches the wet output to have either dry and effected sounds, or just the effect, giving them true double tracking in stereo, live."
