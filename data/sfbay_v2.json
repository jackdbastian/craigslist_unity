It's in extremely good condition for a sample, and has just been stored in our closet for the past year.Includes a rose gold belt and delicate veil with floral embroidery. You can also have the protective garment bag to keep it clean.Fit: Street size 6 or 8. It's a gorgeous structured fabric that nips in at the waist and creates an hourglass figure. I hope someone will love it as much as I did!Selling it for a crazy low price because I know how hard it is to get married during this pandemic and I'd just love to make someone's day! :) We need it to be picked up this weekend."

Has a lot of built in effects, such as reverb, delay, phaser, flanger, etc, and different amp styles, like British, metal, clean, AC15, others. A cool feature is a power level on the back which allows you to adjust the volume output without fiddling with the actual controls.Please note that there are some rips on the tolex in some spots.Open to fair trades, especially on bass amps and guitar pedals.PLEASE no cashiers check or any nonsense."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "This guitar is a 1970\u2019s Japanese knockoff of a Gibson ES-175. These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."
