                "description": "Likely from the 1950\u2019s or before, this vintage purse / handbag is covered in Java aka Ring Lizard Skin in dark brown and buff with the ring pattern evident. It includes the  taxidermied Lizard Head with stuffed and raised, neck, shoulders, arms and hands. The head and front feet are masterfully sewed on the purse front. It\u2019s really unique.  I can\u2019t find anything like it on the internet. The purse has 3 small pouches inside, and a slot on the outside back. It has a spacious interior and doesn\u2019t appear to have ever been used. It measures 10 \u00bc\u201d wide, 6 \u00be\u201d high (excluding the handle), and 9 \u00bd\u201d (with the handle).  It is in excellent vintage condition.We are downsizing our collections, check out our other postings to see if there are other items of interest.

                "description": "Purchased this stunning lace gown brand new for our wedding in Fall 2019.  We were planning on finding it a new home last year, but well, you know, the world shut down.  So 2021 it is! It\u2019s in excellent condition: no rips, tears, snags, or stains. The very bottom edge of the dress is a little dirty in front (normal dance floor dirt), but it should come out easily with a little spot cleaning, or you could get the whole dress dry cleaned. It was more comfortable than most dresses I tried on, and light boning in the torso provides support and security. I absolutely loved this dress (so did my spouse!) and got tons of compliments from our guests.We made two modifications to this dress:1) Had three simple hooks and loops attached to bustle the dress.  Total life saver, especially on the dance floor! (See photos)2) At the shoulder seam where you'd normally get the dress altered to fit you, we decided to take in the entirety of the shoulders and turn the gown into a halter.  We did not have any fabric cut off or removed- the shoulder fabric is meticulously folded in and sewn into the dress, so when you get the gown tailored to fit you, you can either leave it as a halter or return it to its shouldered state. The halter connects with a silver necklace with hidden closure. (See photos)I included some of our wedding photos so you can see the dress in action.  It photographs great, in color and B&W.More information, specs, and photos here:https://www.bhldn.com/products/ludlow-gown?color=Almond%2FIvory&size=6If you haven\u2019t already tried on this dress, this isn\u2019t a confusing wedding dress size. My normal dress size is 4, and this dress fit me perfectly at size 4, no alterations for size were necessary. I\u2019m 5\u2019 6.5\u201d and wore 3\u201d wedges, and the dress grazed the ground in front.BHLDN still sells this dress, so hey, go try it, and then buy it from us and save on the price and no tax :).  For serious local inquiries, I'm sure we can figure out a way for you to try it on.Anthropologie, BHLDN, Wedding"

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.

No low ballers or trade offers pleaseWhat is the Acidbox lll? --> Erica Synths Acidbox III brings you the core of the famous Polivoks VCF in stereo version with a unique audio signal overdrive circuit, built in LFO and envelope follower in a compact, full aluminium case. Features Polivoks core stereo lowpass/bandpass VCF with the original programmable opamps Unique audio overdrive circuit Versatile syncable LFO with 8 waveforms Tap tempo button Envelope follower with modulation level attenuverter Master modulation control Manual and CV control over cutoff frequency Configurable control input for footswitch, expression pedal and external LFO/cutoff control Adjustable input gain The Acidbox III has adjustable input gain, therefore it works with various sound sources \u2013 guitars, units with line level signals (synthesizers, grooveboxes, etc.) and modular synths. Configurable control input allows you to connect a bypass footswitch, expression pedal, external cutoff control voltage source and LFO synchronization trigger. This makes the Acidbox an ideal companion in almost every production or live performance setup. A characterful, gritty analogue effect, made all the more flexible by its stereo signal path and modulation options. -Future Music Magazinelists Acidbox III among the best new studio gear of 2018 The acidbox III should appeal to many, thanks to its flexibility. On the most basic of levels, the stereo I/O makes it a perfect addition to a DJ rig, where real-time filtering is easy to control and trip in and out, thanks to the Bypass switch. The envelope follower will appeal to live musicians and there is nothing to stop users from using pedals to control elements such as Bypass on the fly. The Polivoks filter is characterful, with tons of charm, but very dirty with it \u2013 and as a useful colour in a number of settings, this could become a very valuable piece of kit for both live and studio work. - MusicTech Magazine rates Acidbox III 9 out of 10! Erica Synths has finally made the Acidbox' third generation - stereo capable and thus hits the bull's eye. Now it can be applied to all types of signals: for flat mono synths, as a strong character filter or as a special effect in the DJ Booth. On top of that, guitarists and bass players can hook up their instruments and indulge in the funk creating by Envelope Follower shaping the input signal. The Acidbox III can also sound warm, but if you're looking for a comforting soft filter then you should look elsewhere. The Acidbox III sounds confidently different and immediately delivers inspiring results.tags: #moog #oberheim #waldorf #Boss #Pioneer #Yamaha #Roland #Korg #Meris #Strymon #Eurorack #EHX #DeathByAudio"

This was a very recent purchase but I no longer have the need for a compression pedal. Below is the official information on the pedal:The Dyna Comp Compressor is famous for first-rate, no-nonsense approach to tightening up your guitar signal and creating rich, full-bodied sustain. Like the Phase 90, this little red gem is a legend among its kind. The pedals produced in the mid-\u201970s are particularly prized for their unqiue sound and performance.The Script Dyna Comp Compressor combines that old-school sound with a couple of upgrades for modern gigging convenience. Spec\u2019d from our own 1976 Dyna Comp Compressor, this pedal is built around the rare CA3080 metal can integrated circuit (IC), which yields quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range. Thanks to its bypass status LED and AC power jack, you can put this pedal right on your board without worrying over whether the pedal is on or about to lose power.Features    Classic sound with modern upgrades    Quieter operation, greater transparency, and increased dynamic range    Bypass status LED and AC power jackNo trades.
