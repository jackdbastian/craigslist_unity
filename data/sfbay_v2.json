It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing!

                "description": "1970s Penco Deluxe 5 string \u201cMASTERCLONE\u201d banjo. Bow tie inlays. Played very little. LOUD and fantastic sounding banjo. Original head. It weighs 10 lbs 2 oz., with a heavy brass tone ring. The rare \u201cPENCO\u201d models were built in Japan by the same factory that made the Ibanez Artist series banjo line from the mid 1970s through the early 1980s. Due to the horrible decline in quality of Gibson products in the early 1970s these Japanese makers seized on the chance to build high quality clones of the Gibson Mastertone banjos, which eventually led to a lawsuit being filed by Gibson. Nowadays these vintage Japan made banjos have earned the name Masterclones. They have a huge following and are regarded as the very best low price alternatives to the ultra expensive Gibson USA Mastertone banjo lines (~$3,000.00).This one has a built in stereo pickup with a detachable cord for playing through an amplifier.It is in excellent condition with very little fret wear. As seen in the photo, the back of the neck shows the normal milky finish fading that was very common on these Japanese made Masterclones. You will see this on many of the Ibanez Artist models as well. The finish on the back of the neck is excellent, no dings, only the milky discoloration deep in the finish. It comes in its original hard case which is in excellent condition. It comes with a tuning key, cord, and extra strings."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Selling in mint condition my Ceriatone C-Wreck Guitar Amplifier.Original design is based on a Brad Paisley Dr. Z build. Very FAST and transparent EL84 cathode biased amp. Beautiful harmonic distortion without NFB. No tradesPlease note if you order this amp directly from Nik @ Ceriatone, there is a 2-3 month lead-time and international shipping costs & import duties is an added ~$200. All reasonable offer will be considered.The Ceriatone TW series represents our take on yet another famous, rare amplifier line from the United States.The Ceriatone C-Wreck is heavily inspired by an interesting collaboration between the builder of the aforementioned line and another great modern American amp builder.  In topology, it has many similarities to the Rock It!, however we feel this is a further refinement of the design.  The C-Wreck offers a slightly different feel and perhaps an even more satisfying overdriven tone.  As with the Rock It!, the clean and mildly overdriven tones are second to none.Like the other amplifiers from this builder, much of the brilliance in the design is in its simplicity and no-compromises approach to component placement, lead dress, and trying to maintain as unaltered a signal path as possible.  We have kept this approach, but allowed flexibility by offering two different output transformer primary impedances for slightly different feel and harmonic content.Like other Ceriatone amps, we have labored carefully to select the finest components to suit the design, and the Expression uses our specially designed and correct specification custom transformers for superior reliability, frequency response, and feel.Head Dimension : 18.75 x 9.5 x 10.75 inches / Actual Weight : 16kgPower Output\t30 WattFeature Overview\tSingle channelVolume, Treble, Bass, Cut, and Master Volume Controls3-way Bright SwitchHalf Power switch (removes a pair of EL84s and simultaneously rebiases)Fast / Warm Select (selects between high or low plate voltage)Tubes\tPower: 4 x EL84Preamp: 3 x 12AX7/ECC83Rectifier: 5AR4 / GZ34#DR Z #Matchless #Vox #Bad Cat #Two Rock #Fender #Marshall #Mesa #Boutique #HiWatt #AC30"
