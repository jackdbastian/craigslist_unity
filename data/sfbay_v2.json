It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

                "description": "OUCH!  I hate to let this go so cheap, but I'm moving and I have to sell it!Doubles as a FANTASTIC acoustic guitar ampThis is a vintage combo of an amp head and a 15 speaker plus tweeter in its original bassman cabinet. This is a big set up, with huge beautiful tone, and a powerful clean sound. I would never consider selling it if I were not moving. You can hear me playing bass through it on this home-recording cover of CCR's Who Will Stop the Rain: https://soundcloud.com/knife-drop/have-you-ever-seen-the-rain/s-asMVjugTYQ1 Notice how the bass just cuts right through the super noisy loud jangle of the rhythm guitar, without trying to compete for volume. The amp head has a lot of onboard electronics like the EQ, chorus, drive, etc, that you will have to bypass if you want a good clean noiseless tone. For anyone who uses effects to shape their sound, this is the only way to go, but for the casual player who wants the onboard effects- well, to my ear, they are just not useful. There is one broken input jack, and only one input for bypassing the onboard electronics. If you wanted to use the dual input, you would need to make some sort of modifications or repair, and I'm just not sure of the extent of that, so I'm selling this at a price that many players will find very attractive, especially if you demand clear amazing tone, such as for doing studio work that gets the most out of your pedals and instrument.This is also a fantastic amp for playing amplified acoustic or classical guitar through. The huge speaker plus the single horn offer an incredibly full-spectrum lifelike tone, even just plugging straight in and using your pickup's volume and EQ.I also have a couple of basses for sale. If you're interested, remind me when you come to check out the amp."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
