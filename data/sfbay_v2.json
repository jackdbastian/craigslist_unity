Hence me buying another dress in my size and selling this one.This bridal dress is brand new. While I bought it on sale, the original price was over $1,600. Asking $299 OBO."

It has a rebuilt engine that was swapped with a B20, still has the VTEC heads, manual transmission, and is a blast to drive. It runs great and I would not think twice to take this car on a long road trip. It has aftermarket suspension and it handles better than a 2008 m3. Shoot me an offer. I have the original seats as well that I can include if you want them as well. The car has a real carbon fiber hood, I put a wrap on it to protect it. It sounds awesome, real throaty for a 4cil, and feels like I'm driving in the original Fast & Furious movie.

I actually have two of these and could sell both but I need one for a wedding in a couple weeks so for now I can only sell one. I also have one (1) OnStage speaker stand that is available with the set after the wedding. Anyway, if you just want one (1) I can sell that now for $180.Clean, punchy, loud, no issues! Just a few scuffs on the heavy duty molded plastic. Screw to tighten onto a stand still present and working well. These are great because you can literally just plug an XLR cable and a mic straight into them if you want for a quick and minimal PA system. Add a mixer for a full band, DJ setup, etc.Come by and pick it up. I will wear a mask and can show it in the open air in my garage. Cash or Venmo only. Map on this post is accurate. If you see this post it's available, don't ask."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."
