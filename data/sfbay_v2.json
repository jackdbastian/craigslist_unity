It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

                "description": "This is a pair of vintage black gloves by Fownes. They feel and look like very supple leather however the tag does not state any leather material. These have a 100% fur lining 15% nylon fourchette and were made in the Philippines according to the tag in the left glove. The fur lining is luxuriously soft and is a mix of browns, grays, and white. I believe the letter B is the size. The gloves are approximately 10 long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening. They are in very excellent cosmetic condition with just a few small blemishes as shown.------Please call, text, or email anytime.Thank you,Ed"

Runs, drives, shifts great.Front wheel drive with automatic transmission.I am the third owner, the first two were in the same family and took good care of the car. I bought the car for a family member to use and they put around 2k miles in 5 months but they have since decided to go in a different direction as their needs have changed. In my care I have changed the oil, transmission fluid & filter, alternator (was original), added weatherproof floor mats, fixed the broken door lock actuators (typical), added a bluetooth adapter w/ mic to the stereo (replaces the CD changer), and had a second key made with remote entry. Has the Lexus premium stereo which sounds great, AC blows cold. The tires are in good shape with plenty of life left. The front seats are worn, I have a set of covers that are included but I never got around to installing. The title is clean, in my name and I have it in hand. Passed smog 5/23. Registration is current, expires in Sept. Carfax is clean and I can email it to you. I am asking $4900. Text or call and leave voicemail -  . Cash Only! Located in Oakland near the zoo."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
