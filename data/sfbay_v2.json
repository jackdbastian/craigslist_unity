Car already has new the steel gear box which replaced by dealer under TSB 08-003-21,  huge improvement on handling.  I purchased Mopar Max Care warranty plan,  it will last until 5/5/2025 or 60,000 miles.  That\u2019s another four years bumper to bumper warranty,  it should be transferable.   The windshield is crack now but I will have it fix before the sale.  Kbb private party average price is $48000 without all the upgrade.  With the upgrade it should be priced $59000 without the Mopar max care.   What I am asking is very reasonable.  Please contact me only when you are ready to buy.  I am not rushing to sell it.

Comes with working OEM Reverb/Tremelo Footswitch. Killer, killer sound both with my '79 ES335 and my '75 Telecaster Custom.Footpedal sound? I have no idea. this amp delivers all the sound I need. It's just too loud I can't push it at home.If you know what this, you know what it's worth. And, it will always appreciate in the market. Never gonna make 'em anymore. Nothing beats the tone quality of these original vintage FENDER's. (In my opinion, nothing ever will.)  Will consider offers. Selling as a unit only."
