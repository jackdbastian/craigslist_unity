Out of the box condition. They are great quality gloves, I just need to buy an XL instead of a L.REV'IT! Volcano GlovesThe Volcano Gloves from REV'IT! are the lightest ADV gloves in the REV'IT! collection with CE certification. Designed with a mix of on-road and off-road use in mind, the Volcano Gloves are more robust than a full dirt glove and feature a fortified microfiber synthetic palm. Air mesh on the back of hand keeps the hands cool and dry during high effort maneuvers. TPR knuckle sliders with Seesoft viscoelastic backing add protection. Temperfoam can be found again at the palm and thumb. A hook and loop closure keeps the gloves secure, and an oversized pull loop makes for easy entry.

He is an orchid grower and used it to transport his plants all over the state (mostly freeway miles).  I fixed a few small problems and it's been a solid reliable vehicle for us. It's also an extra vehicle, (we've driven it under 2000 miles in 2 years) and as nice as it was to have it, we don't need it. So time to move it on.Recent repairs/////In the last 2000 miles are-Valve Cover Gaskets (because they were leaking) and Valve Adjustment and new Spark Plugs at that time -Front Axles-Air & Cabin Filters-Transmission drain & fill-Installed a Blue Tooth / phone setup//////In the last 10,000 miles/////-Front Brake Pads and Rotors-Right Rear Wheel Bearing////////////////////////////////////////////The Timing Belt & Water Pump, Bearings + Tensioner were replaced at 115,000 in 2002 (Original Honda Parts) Rear Brakes are better than 50% leftMichelin Tires have about 40% or so leftThe right rear corner has got dinged a couple times (by a couple different people) it's not bad tried to show it. Some wear on the Passengers front seat on the side and armrest and drivers armrest"

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.
