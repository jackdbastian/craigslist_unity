Runs, drives, shifts great.Front wheel drive with automatic transmission.I am the third owner, the first two were in the same family and took good care of the car. I bought the car for a family member to use and they put around 2k miles in 5 months but they have since decided to go in a different direction as their needs have changed. In my care I have changed the oil, transmission fluid & filter, alternator (was original), added weatherproof floor mats, fixed the broken door lock actuators (typical), added a bluetooth adapter w/ mic to the stereo (replaces the CD changer), and had a second key made with remote entry. Has the Lexus premium stereo which sounds great, AC blows cold. The tires are in good shape with plenty of life left. The front seats are worn, I have a set of covers that are included but I never got around to installing. The title is clean, in my name and I have it in hand. Passed smog 5/23. Registration is current, expires in Sept. Carfax is clean and I can email it to you. I am asking $4900. Text or call and leave voicemail -  . Cash Only! Located in Oakland near the zoo."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

They are just a couple of years old, sealed, and thus as good as new.These are no longer made so are hard to find. Martin was using Cleartone for the coating at this point, but since then they have formulated their own in-house coating which they now call Lifespan 2.0. I have not tried those strings so do not know how they compare. Perhaps because no licensing fees are involved, they are a bit cheaper.These sold for $19 each and sets of 3 would typically go for over $40. I scoured a site named after a famous Brasilian river to get an idea of what a fair price would be. The posted price is for three sets as it is an unopened box."

It is openhole, inline G, C foot and was restored by Daniel Deitch in San Francisco.The sound is warm and sweet and has nothing to do with the volume of the 21st century.It comes in the original case."
