Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "=> Offering the slightly rare, but still great, Fender Rivera Twin - with factory JBLs! These \u2018E120\u2019s  are a continuation of the legendary \u2018D120\u2019s (that were premium options on earlier Fender amps!)! So the \u2018voice\u2019 of this one is going to be different from a \u2018bone stock Twin Reverb II\u2019\u2026 Aside from a bit of cosmetic wear - it is just serviced -and sounds amazing.=> There seems to be a lot of misinformation about this model... What you should know is that \u2018channel one\u2019 contains the entire original \u2018black face era\u2019 Fender circuit\u2026 While Rivera did make some changes to resistors and capacitors to allow a gain channel to share the preamp - his \u2018clean\u2019 channel still has that immediately familiar Fender vibe\u2026 Rivera\u2019s design revisions included a new universal \u2018acoustic presence\u2019 control (not on previous Twins) to effectively offset the slightly \u2018darker\u2019 voicing... And please note - your Reverb is now also exists in channel one! So think of this as your old \u2018channel two\u2019 (minus \u2018tremolo\u2019 - which you can run through the new effects loop!). The JBLs are game changers:Any combo with these speakers is going to be its own animal tonally - and unlike others of its kind. They put out so much sound across all frequencies that your \u2018power curve\u2019 will be unique to \u2018this model plus the JBLs\u2019! That said - it is a little less bright (or scooped) than other Twins - if you just set your EQ \u2018flat\u2019 - with the Presence control and \u2018Brightness\u2019 off! But Rivera\u2019s design did add the new \u2018acoustic presence\u2019 feature (as noted), as an offset - to dial in more upper frequencies - and of course - you\u2019re going to set the tri-band EQ to your liking! So scoop away! Ultimately you can shape your guitar tone to be very close to a legacy Twin\u2019s\u2026 The \u2018E120\u2019s will deliver upper range clarity like you\u2019ve never heard, anyway... The \u2018brightness\u2019 can easily be worked out with the various controls provided and your guitar settings. But you cannot rig the floor shaking power and definition of these JBLs with the regular speakers (which aren\u2019t bad either, IMHO).Famous JBL E120 users:Turns out both Garcia and SRV liked these in their stage rigs. Please note that both of these guys liked a bright, clear base tone, to start off with - and any effects got layered on from there. Obviously Jerry was known for his very long form leads - often coming into a mix with five other instruments vamping or soloing away behind him\u2026 I was not in the SRV club when he played New Years Eve at Henry Kaiser. Can say that he played some of the longest, cleanest, and most fluid lead lines - with notes that seemed to just fly through the air (and no, I wasn\u2019t on anything at the time!). Apparently the \u2018E\u2019 speaker may have been the brightest of the \u2018120\u2019 series, and featured a ceramic magnet\u2026 So this would seem to offset any concerns about the Rivera Twin being \u2018too dark\u2019. New features and improvements on this amp:  The reverb now works in both channels! Finally! So your clean tone palette is now in channel one, and, Fyi - it still has more in common with a \u2018blackface\u2019 or \u2018silverface\u2019 Twin than not! Rumors of the differences have been greatly exaggerated (to say the least!). As mentioned - the new \u2018acoustic presence\u2019 control is in both channels - and does add a tapered high to upper mid range \u2018bump\u2019 (on your frequency curve). The Fender \u2018JBL option\u2019 was a \u2018deluxe\u2019 release - adding speakers that will make you rethink what you thought you knew about great sound! Believe me - I have considered doing a \u2018head-cab\u2019 conversion just to keep them.Paul Rivera\u2019s early eighties amps were the last of the hand wired Fenders. Sound-wise - they offer a bridge from the past to the present... Many users have said that \u2018channel one\u2019 sounds very much like a legacy Twin (of the nineteen sixties) - while the gain channel points in some new directions... Yes, exactly! As mentioned - the \u2018clean\u2019 side of this combo can be adjusted to sound very much like an \u2018original Twin\u2019 - and now there is \u2018universal\u2019 reverb\u2026 Fyi - the amp can be fully \u2018black faced\u2019 by a competent tech (with about a half dozen changes to some resistors and capacitors)\u2026 It is fully hackable, for those with real electronics skills\u2026 But you shouldn\u2019t need to! The great quality is already there. No modifications needed (but you can, if it matters).With a dedicated lead/ drive circuit - you can now \u2018preset\u2019 this Twin with extra midrange and \u2018edge\u2019 for your solos or lead breaks... You just need to master the second channel\u2026 The \u2018drive\u2019 effect requires a bit more study to dial in than on some \u2018high gain\u2019 amps, but it is most definitely there! And it can be had at reasonable volumes. You just need to learn how it works\u2026 Of course, if you are interested in buying the amp, I would be happy to share these \u2018secrets\u2019. None of the internet \u2018buzz\u2019 about this model makes the \u2018Twin II\u2019 a lessor amp... \u2018Your sound\u2019 is still very much \u2018in the box\u2019. You just dial it in a little differently... The \u2018JBL Twins\u2019:The James B Lansing speakers are now really sought after... There\u2019s a silverface \u2018JBL\u2019 Twin for sale nearby for a mere $1899.00 ! It features the earlier \u2018D120\u2019 versions of what\u2019s in this amp\u2026 So there you go\u2026 $845 versus $1899... A friend of mine does play through a \u2018blackface\u2019 Twin - and my first lead player\u2019s amp was an early silverface. This one is not so different - given these special speakers. As mentioned, the Fender labeled \u2018E120s\u2019 are just early eighties updates of the \u2018D\u2019 series JBLs offered in the sixties and seventies.  There\u2019s a promo for them in the gallery above. Fender applied their own \u2018in-house\u2019 stock numbers and labeling, which can be translated, if you\u2019re curious. But tone freaks take note - they are a very different animal than the \u2018stock\u2019 Fender blue labels (which are good speakers IMHO) - or even most competitors\u2026 Any solos or power chords played through these \u2018E120\u2019s will cut through like nothing else. You\u2019ll be \u2018driving that train\u2019 - not sitting in the caboose.The 18 pound magnets can take a 300 watt \u2018dynamic peak\u2019 - while the amp is only pushing 105 watts (continuous). Cannot emphasize how great they sound! Purchased separately - the \u2018120\u2019s can be had for a mere four hundred dollars a pair (or one for two fifty)... \u2018Lansing\u2019 were an industry leader from the 1940\u2019s on; a deep tech powerhouse. Ask any sound engineer.Why does this amp offer the best of \u2018then and now\u2019?As noted, the \u2018cleans\u2019 are less scooped than a \u2018blackface\u2019 or \u2018silverface\u2019 version - it\u2019s true (eg. less \u2018bright\u2019). But they are just as rich and detailed - offering good top end \u2018chime\u2019 and enough decibels to reach the back row of almost any club! The newly added \u2018Presence\u2019 knob is your voicing \u2018offset\u2019. It will work better than the legacy \u2018Brightness\u2019 adjustment - if you\u2019re looking for more \u2018Fender sparkle\u2019! That is still \u2018in the box\u2019\u2026 But now you get the advantages of a true \u2018lead-drive\u2019 preset - that can be used as a \u2018clean\u2019 midrange or \u2018edge-boost\u2019 - leave alone that you can do full on \u2018crunch\u2019 and \u2018grind\u2019! Can\u2019t exactly do all of that with your \u2018legacy\u2019 Twin!  The Rivera Fenders have suffered needlessly from too many comparisons to Randall Smith\u2019s amps. It\u2019s an almost pointless comparison IMHO. Both are great designs with their unique advantages. But you won\u2019t get \u2018cleans\u2019 like this one can do on those, IMHO.As noted - the Rivera \u2018gain channels\u2019 can all be \u2018overdriven\u2019 at modest volumes - given you know how to do the settings... This runs contrary to some online chatter. Would be happy to share the exact tweaks needed, if you\u2019re curious... The settings are less obvious than on some amps - but once you know, you know! Of course, you can also plug in your favorite tube screamer. Unfortunately, I do not have the original two button Fender \u2018footswitch\u2019 channel controller (although they are available on almost any swap board).Condition:It has been well cared for overall: obviously gigged in the past - but fully retubed by a fairly recent owner\u2026 There is a matched quad of reissue \u2018Sovtek 5881/6L6WGC\u2019s - sounding very warm and punchy. Also a septet of mostly newer \u2018Ruby\u2019 preamp tubes... If you\u2019re not familiar, these are hand chosen brands from a \u2018current market\u2019 selection... Ruby applies their own \u2018in house\u2019 testing - after which acceptable valves are \u2018rebranded\u2019 - leaving the original maker\u2019s mark on the glass underneath... A \u2018Ruby/ Jan Phillips 12AT7\u2019 can be seen in the PI spot (above) - while a row of mostly \u2018Ruby/ Tesla\u2019 built 12AX7s (mis-marked as \u2018E83CC/12ax7\u2019) occupy V1 - V6...The amp has just been electronically cleaned; valves re-tensioned; and all thoroughly tested by Phil Milner Amps and Electronics Repair, of San Rafael (per the invoice shown). There is a new speaker wire harness to run the JBLs. All is in order - and the amp is ready for your studio or a live performance. The bottom line:A \u2018fresh approach\u2019 will yield dividends: clean, gritty,\u2018driven\u2019, or boosted\u2026 Your call... The Twin II does drive 105 watts as needed... For jazz and funk fans (like yours truly) - the \u2018normal\u2019 channel has plenty of warmth and \u2018spank\u2019 - while \u2018channel two\u2019 can be set up for solos. Metal may require an extra pedal - but blues-rock, and classic crunch, are all dial-able as is. When it comes to live sound and voicing - your speakers are a game changer... Comparisons to amps of the past may serve to explain differences - but sometimes they get in the way of \u2018the here and now\u2019.Message me with your questions.Can deliver in the Greater Bay Area.Thanks for checking out the ad!  - David"
