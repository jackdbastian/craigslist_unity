Wear it for church, summer garden parties or Kentucky Derby.The crown of the hat says Lancaster, 100% wool, made in USA.  It is trimmed with nylon horsehair and petersham ribbon.  It is not labeled with a size, but it is loose enough for a hairdo to fit under it, as I recall from when I wore it a couple of times years ago.  My best guess is that it's from the 1930s, but for sure it's at least vintage, since I found it at an estate sale over 20 years ago.Price is firm; please bring cash (or I would also trade for 100% silk yarn, or pear cider, let me know).  I can meet in Berkeley most days, and I can also sometimes meet in Alameda, San Leandro, Albany, or north Oakland.  We can meet outdoors for Covid safety.  Sending a plain text will get you a faster response than email.  thanks"

Fists wrist from about 6.5 inches to 8 inches in diameter.  It has no damage or defects other than you need someone else to tie it on for you.Be advised I live way up on Mount Tamalpais off of Panoramic Highway above Mill Valley 15 minutes off of the 101. I can be talked into meeting at the Manzanita Parking Lot 40 Shoreline Highway if that is more convenient."

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

Amp comes with a Celestion Vintage 30 16ohm speaker.The reverb doesnt work at present, but everything is there.The speaker value is $150. Included are repair documents and notes from recent amp recapping.BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!As part of this deal you also get - 2-vintage alnico speakers (30w?) in a cabinet with wiring to plug into amp ext speaker jack. the cabinet is from an 80s Marshall amp cabinet. Also inside the cabinet is a reverb tank (~16).- Amp hardware from a polytone minibrute 90 watt amp. polytone cabinet/spkr are not included. - Amp hardware, turntable(s), tubes from an old rca record player. another vintage speaker with original fabric.I'd like to get all these cleared out, so if you're looking for amp parts (tube and solid state), this is your opportunity to get a bunch of stuff for cheap. First come first served.                         Thanks for your interest!"

                "description": "AMAZING EASY TO PLAY CAN'T BEAT TAYLOR $800 INCLUDES HARD SHELL CASE Taylor 150e Dreadnought 12-String Acoustic-Electric Guitar Naturalitem# 1500000279193Taylor's 100 Series, which now includes the 150e 12-String Dreadnought acoustic-electric guitar, makes a great guitar-playing experience accessible to everyone with these real wood instruments. For people taking the first or next step in their musical journey, these instruments promise to accelerate players' growth and enhance their enjoyment. Taylor's famous neck profile combined with a 1 11/16 nut width make it easy for developing players to form barre chords. The 150e 12-String Dreadnought acoustic-electric guitar comes with a durable, 600-denier nylon gig bag with double-stitched seams and reinforced stress points, built by Taylor for an optimal fit.Body ShapeThe Dreadnought is one of the most traditional acoustic guitar shapes. Taylor's version has been refined to blend its trademark robust low-end tone with a snappy midrange and brilliant treble notes, producing a pleasing balance of power and articulation. If you're a flatpicker or strummer who likes to dig in on lead or rhythm, the Dreadnought should serve you well.TonewoodsA guitar's top is the primary filter and distributor of vibrating string energy through the guitar, which means it has a huge impact on its sound. Sitka Spruce is the most prevalent guitar top wood of the modern era. It blends stiffness and elasticity in just the right proportions which translates into broad dynamic range with crisp articulation. The arched back of the guitar generates more sound from a small-bodied instrument, and using layered wood back and sides create a sturdy yet receptive platform for the vibrating string energy sent by the guitar's top. Layered wood is also less susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity, making it an excellent choice for players who travel with their instruments or simply require more durability.ElectronicsTaylor's ES2 is a revolutionary pickup design that delivers the latest in Taylor\u2019s ongoing innovation in acoustic guitar amplification. The heart of the Expression System 2 is Taylor\u2019s patented behind-the-saddle pickup, which features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors. Because the pickup doesn't sit under the saddle, the bottom of the saddle comes in full contact with the bridge, allowing all the nuance of the guitar's tone to come through clearly whether playing acoustically or plugged-in. The location of the sensors enables a more dynamic range of acoustic sound to be captured than ever before while playing plugged-in. Together with Taylor\u2019s custom-designed \u201cprofessional audio\u201d-grade preamp, this system produces exceptional amplified tone and responsiveness. On stage through a PA, plugged into your favorite acoustic amplifier, or direct into recording software, the Expression System 2 faithfully conveys the voice of your Taylor guitar. The Taylor Expression System 2 operates through a proprietary 9-volt battery compartment and easy-to-use volume, and active bass and treble controls.Other FeaturesTaylor is famous for its 12-string guitars due to their ease-of-play, their stability, their intonation and their overall tone. The Taylor Neck's slim neck profile and precision system allow precise and low action, resulting in the most comfortable handfeel found in a 12-string. The Taylor 150e is Taylor's most affordable 12-string to date, and the same attributes that make a high-end Taylor 12-string great are found on the 150e.The Taylor DifferenceWhat sets Taylor Guitars apart? Unmatched build quality, the most stable and playable necks, a vast array of tonal options, eco-conscious and ethically-sourced raw materials, and a lifetime of service and support.Specifications:BodyBody type: Taylor DreadnoughtCutaway: NoTop wood: Solid Sitka SpruceBack & sides: Layered WalnutBracing pattern: 100 Series 12-String Bracing PatternBody finish: Satin VarnishOrientation: Right-HandedNeckNeck shape: Standard Taylor 12-String ProfileNut width: 1-7/8 (47.6mm)Fingerboard: Genuine African EbonyNeck wood: Hard Rock MapleScale length: 25-1/2Number of frets: 20Neck finish: Satin VarnishElectronicsPickup/preamp: Expression System 2 Professional Audio-GradeBrand: TaylorConfiguration: Behind-the-Saddle Transducer with Adjustable SensorsPreamp EQ: Volume, Active Bass and TrebleFeedback filter: Onboard Phase SwitchTuner: NoneOtherHeadstock overlay: West African EbonyTuning machines: Die-cast Chrome Mini Tuners with Chrome ButtonsBridge: West African EbonySaddle & nut: Micarta Wave Saddle; NuBone NutNumber of strings: 12Special features: n/aCase: Deluxe Taylor Gig BagAccessories: None"

                "description": "This guitar is a 1970\u2019s Japanese knockoff of a Gibson ES-175. These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."
