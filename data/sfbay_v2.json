It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

Please read whole ad before calling, many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax, no accidents, 2 owner. 20 service records all Acura of Stockton from new up to 85K when I got it. No accidents, Accurate Mileage, California Car, etcI bought this Acura in 2015 with 85K on it, was an original owner car always maintained at the dealer. When I got it the transmission was going out. These cars are notorious for the auto trans to fail, not a matter of if but when. If you replace it with a rebuilt it will do it all over again because there is an inherent design flaw. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except by then they finally fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable.  At 100K I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) which I know because I ran the carfax from the Vin plate on the trans before I bought it. I replace the fluid every 15K, it works flawlessly, shifts crisp, and has limited slip meaning both tires will spin up if you try to showoff and spin the tires (which it will if you wanna get frisky lol)Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and the power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsAnd More I have forgotten Im sureNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height (not too low)*Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful, not overdone, it is really fast if you want it to be or easy enough for my high school daughter to drive it. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work!, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The Bads:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.** Needs Tires ASAP, I thought about replacing them with some cheapies to sell it but I figure ill let the next owner pick their own tires and ill knock off $500 from the price to an even 7K.  **So if you're still reading 7K is my final take it or leave it price, If you want to negotiate because its an older car, bluebook and compare it to a bunch of junks on craiglist the price is back to 7500 :) I don't need to sell anytime soon. Ill just keep it, I don't drive it often anymore so it should go to the next person to keep it pristine. This is becoming sort of a Japanese Muscle Car, you won't find a 2003; the last year, in all black, with the black headlights and the silver matter interior accents (instead of the cheesy woodgrain on the other years) with low miles like this and well maintained with bullet proof trans already swapped and timing belt done.Its a lot to read but instead of explaining it all over, if you call me with questions that can be answered here I'm just going to tell you to read the ad. Thanks!Cody"

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

This upright piano is from 1970s. We are consolidating rooms at our small music school, and now there are too many instruments in one office. Imagine that the piano has been recently TUNED and regulated.  You'll only need to hire your movers. No stairs in the building Chickering has been  famous for many decades before getting sold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4yfS1bEHz8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SylNUF5510E By the way, in the same room, we have also two Chickering grand pianos, which we use for teaching.
