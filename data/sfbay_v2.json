                "description": "YES, WE ARE DELIVERING THROUGH THE SHELTER IN PLACE DUE TO THE FACT THAT AGRICULTURAL DELIVERIES ARE EXEMPT. WE WILL NOT COME NEAR YOU PERSONALLY AND RESPECT ALL SOCIAL DISTANCING PRACTICES. BE SAFE AND TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER.Assorted tree chips for garden mulch, weed suppression, dry fill for a muddy horse corral, to keep the dust down on dry roads or dry corrals, or erosion control to keep the local creeks and streams clean and clear.THE PICTURES ARE FOR REPRESENTATION, WE GET ALL TYPES OF MULCH, (NOTHING THAT WOULD HURT HORSES). IF YOU CALL OR EMAIL IN A REQUEST FOR A LOAD, YOU WILL GET WHAT IS NEXT IN THE PILE FOR LOADING. IF YOU WANT SPECIFIC PRODUCT, YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME HERE AND PICK OUT YOUR MULCH. IF YOU DON'T PICK OUT YOUR MULCH PERSONALLY, YOU GET WHAT YOU GET. This is B grade, which means it's assorted tree types, and not screened for size like the more expensive product at the nursery, it will have twigs and leaves. This mulch will work for you the same as the expensive nursery mulch but you will save more than half price.I have a tractor to load your truck or trailer, it's 3-4 buckets to fill up the bed of the average full size truck bed, but I'll measure your bed and tell you how many square yards it will hold, and we'll go from there. THERE IS A $20 MINIMUM CHARGE FOR ME TO USE MY TRACTOR TO LOAD YOUR TRUCK OR TRAILER, TRACTOR CHARGE FOR ANY LOAD OVER 6YDS IS $30. IF YOU'D LIKE TO BRING YOUR OWN SHOVEL, AND LOAD YOUR TRAILER OR TRUCK YOURSELF, THAT IS FINE WITH ME. It's $20 for up to 3 yards, and $6 per yard after that. This is about 1/4 the price of what you'd pay at the landscape yards.***THERE IS $40 MINIMUM, (CHIPS AND LOADING TOTAL), FOR ANY CHIP PICKUP.****If you need a larger quantity than you can transport on your own, I have a trailer I can tow to your house with a dump bed that holds 6 yards. I charge $40 for a full trailer of chips, with a $45 minimum for delivery, (which includes one hour of load time). One load with delivery is $85 if you are local, (Northeast Petaluma, Downtown Penngrove, South Cotati, etc).If you need a lot of chips and would like to talk about having full truck loads brought straight to your property. A full truck load is about 4 trailer loads, but it's the cost of 3 trailer loads, so it's like buying 3 and getting one free. The cost, with delivery, depends on where you are located.IF YOU ARE SHOPPING AROUND WITH OTHER CHIP VENDORS ON CL, MAKE SURE THEY ARE INCLUDING A DUMP TRAILER, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE SHOVELING CHIPS AT YOUR PLACE OUT OF THEIR TRUCK.How much volume can your pickup hold?A full size 3/4 or 1 ton pickup can hold 3 about cubic yards, slightly rounded, but product weight must be considered. Most full size pickups can handle 3 yards of mulch. Never load more than what is reasonable or what your vehicle is specified to carry. A smaller compact pickup will haul about 1/2 what a full size pickup will carry.How much does a yard of product weigh?Weights for our products will vary from winter to summer because of the moisture content in the product. Typically, mulch products will weigh between 500 to 800 lbs. per cubic yard.One cubic yard= (3' x 3' x 3'= 27 cubic feet)Coverage of one cubic yard by inches deep, keep in mind that a full 6 yard load will be 6 times these numbers.1 inch deep covers 324 sq. ft. per yard2 inch deep covers 162 sq. ft. per yard3 inch deep covers 108 sq. ft. per yard4 inch deep covers 81 sq. ft. per yard5 inch deep covers 54 sq. ft. per yardIf you've ever shoveled 6 yards of mulch, you'll find that $40 for not having to shovel out a pick up truck full of mulch is a bargain. Not only will you not have to spend 2 hours to shovel it out of your truck or trailer, but you won't have to pay for the round trip gas in your truck for two or three trips.All and all, a pretty good deal.We work to do our part to responsibly utilize the wood waste and convert it into a usable resource. Many of our customers like this and support the effort by utilizing mulch themselves. Many contractors use this material also for Soil Building & Erosion Control.This product works great for Soil Building, Weed Control, Garden, and all of your Landscaping needs.With the threat of drought up ahead, protect your soil moisture and use mulch to retain moisture around your plants while controlling the spread of Weeds. When you apply mulch it can help retain soil moisture by controlling evaporation of applied water to plants.I have lots of repeat customers, so I must be doing something right.WITH SO MUCH SPAM ON CRAIGSLIST, I'LL ONLY RESPOND TO INQUIRIES WITH A NAME, PHONE NUMBER AND TOWN WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE THE MULCH DELIVERED IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PICK IT UP YOURSELF."

No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"

The reason I bought this one, is that it has a lot power (volume) so I could play with a loud, live rock drummer. It does not disappoint! I was able to play along with a full, loud rock band, without feedback on my acoustic. Amazing!It's got a couple of scuffs on the edge rails (pictured) from moving around.. But, other than that, this amp functions as new. Even comes in the original box! Also included is the 2-button footswitch, which is normally sold separately. THIS IS THE LOWEST PRICE FOR THIS AMP ON REVERB, SO ACT FAST!NOTE: This is not the model that has Bluetooth connectivity.More product details:The re-designed Fishman Loudbox Performer acoustic guitar amp offers 180W of transparent bi-amplified acoustic tone and enhanced features. Thanks to more efficient design you'll get all these improvements in a lighter package too.The Loudbox Performer features two input channels, each with 3-band EQ, feedback-fighting controls and a new effects section. The dedicated midrange provides enhanced detail and note definition. An integrated kickstand design allows the Loudbox Performer to be tilted back 50 degree for better sound projection at short range.FeaturesPower: 180W, bi-ampedTwo channelsInputs: XLR-1/4 in. combo with 10dB padSpeakers: one 8 in. woofer; one 5 in. midrange; one 1 in. soft-dome tweeterBuilt-in FX: Reverb, Chorus, Flanger, Delay, Echo and Slap EchoSPL: 114dB SPL @ 1 meterFeedback-fighting Phase switch and Notch filterSpeaker Baffle: 10-degree built-in tiltAux. input with level control50-degree with kickstandHeadphone outputPhantom power for condenser mics (24V, high current spec.)Mute switchBalanced XLR DI outputsDimensions: 18.2 in. x 15.8 in. x 11.5 in.
