Cabinet is unmarred. Tuning pins are tight. String wire is shiny. Has been kept in a very stable environment with proper humidity.This instrument may have an obscure brand, but the company has had a rich history as a piano of choice to Chopin, Debussy, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Ravel, de Falla and Stravinsky. Many famous piano instructors also chose Pleyel \u2013 read about in the Wikipedia. Pleyels rise above the other mass-produced pianos like Yamaha, Kawai and Petrof. They are more comparable to Schimmel. As they are not produced in great volume, the construction is more crafted. If you read the piano forums, folks tend to come back and purchase the Pleyel. They really do stand out above others.\u2022\tConsistent quality\u2022\tSweet sound and powerful bass section\u2022\tExcellent dynamic ability\u2022\tRenner action including hammers special to this piano\u2022\tAction touch is slightly lighter than average\u2022\tVery robust frame (piano weighs over 600 lbs)\u2022\tGorgeous wood graining and finish. Top notch.Recommend you play the Kawai, Yamaha, etc. first and then try this instrument. It is likely your last stop! There are extremely few that are being sold used. Most musicians keep them once acquired."

                "description": "The Yamaha YBS-52 is the little brother to the famous YBS-62 .It's not the most expensive bari sax but it is the most popular bari sax made today . It is recommended by just about every saxophone teacher .It gives you the most bang for the buck . It is thousands of dollars cheaper than the 62 but has has exactly the same scale and key work with the exception of no high F# key ( but who needs it ! )Bari saxes in general tend to get pretty beat up . It's a big instrument . This one is in above average condition . There are signs of some dent removal but it is nice and straight with good lacquer.It has had all dents taken out , lacquer touched up , body joint sealed , re assembled and regulated .It plays great and has a real BARK to the bottom end .This is a later upgraded model withe tilting low Bb touchThe original case is in good  condition . The case sometimes takes more of a beating than the sax .retail price is over $8000 , internet price is around $5600 . Save yourself a couple of thousand dollars and get a bari that plays as good as new if not better.It comes with everything needed to play it . . I also have bari's below this one .  As far as I can see it is the only nice used one around for sale !Only e-mails with ph # will be replied to"
