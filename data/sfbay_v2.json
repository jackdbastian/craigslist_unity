We can walk you through the entire process. First timers no need to be anxious, this is supposed to be FUN. The #1 comment customers say is \u201cWow it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought, I\u2019m glad you told me to try it\u201d   We aren\u2019t in the furniture business.

Thank you to everyone that has consciously chosen to purchase the foundation of their project from us . My partners and I invest so much heart into recycling mother nature\u2019s artwork and it is an indescribable feeling to have you guys recognize both the beauty and the effort put forth to give these logs a second life. It is so special for us to be a part of your story. Making the decision to spend your hard earned money on something we worked tirelessly to provide is not something we take lightly or for granted. We appreciate you! STACK EM\u2019 UP!!-Eric Christopher                            Process1. Decide on a project2. Measure the designated available space, keeping in mind the sizes of other nearby objects. Keeping things proportional will help your space feel sophisticated & curated rather than out of place or overbearing.3. Come Look! The fun begins here! Everyone\u2019s taste is different so it\u2019s best to complete steps 1 & 2 and then come look at our inventory and see if anything screams \u201cTake me home\u201d Our inventory is constantly changing. I tell customers \u201cour store is like a shoe store. We don\u2019t always have every size/model/color but it might be tomorrow that we bring the desired material in. Our inventory is based on the trees we are able to give a second life to, not the \u201cclick of a button\u201d reorder.4. Price is based on many factors as each boule is unique in it\u2019s own way and each boule is in a different state of its life. The main factors we consider are:-Size (board foot aka volume of material)-Species -Figure-Moisture content-Raw or SurfacedOnce Home 1. Decide on the aesthetic look you want to achieve. Do you want the piece to be rustic or lean towards a clean \u201cscuplted\u201d look?2.Remove the bark. We like to use a \u201ccats paw\u201d and a mallet, working pieces off as large as possible. For hardwoods a draw knife works well.3.Sand, scuplt, and clean-up the edges (if that follows suit towards your desired look. ) If a rustic look is desired you may wish to leave the edge as is.  4.Sand the top & bottom. We generally start at 60 grit, working our way through the grits until at least 400 grit. THIS IS NOT a requirement, just our preference. The higher grits do not only make the wood fibers smoother, they allow the true beauty of the wood to expose itself. The 3D figure is more pronounced and shows a higher level of visual contrast. Some figured woods we sand 1200+ grit. THE FINISH YOU CHOOSE MAY DICTATE WHAT GRIT YOU STOP SANDING AT. Some finish brands call for designated end points wich are usually lower in grit than our preference of 400 grit. Many require a max of 220 grit. Read manufactures directions to see if they specify. Once sanded up to 100 grit we like to then cut ends to size if needed, then continue sanding working our way up through the grits. We sand a bit before cutting to size because it makes for less friction on the saw, which usually helps make a smooth, clean cut.We blow off the slab with compressed air and wipe the entire slab with a tac cloth to remove loose dust, prepping the slab for its finish stage.For more information Contactphone  Website: www.EricChristopherArt.comemail Eric@ErichChristopherArtFb @EricChristopherArtIg @EricChristopherArtAddress:5325 Gravenstein Highway NorthSebastopol, CA 95472"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."

Very FAST and transparent EL84 cathode biased amp. Beautiful harmonic distortion without NFB. No tradesThe Ceriatone TW series represents our take on yet another famous, rare amplifier line from the United States.The Ceriatone C-Wreck is heavily inspired by an interesting collaboration between the builder of the aforementioned line and another great modern American amp builder.  In topology, it has many similarities to the Rock It!, however we feel this is a further refinement of the design.  The C-Wreck offers a slightly different feel and perhaps an even more satisfying overdriven tone.  As with the Rock It!, the clean and mildly overdriven tones are second to none.Like the other amplifiers from this builder, much of the brilliance in the design is in its simplicity and no-compromises approach to component placement, lead dress, and trying to maintain as unaltered a signal path as possible.  We have kept this approach, but allowed flexibility by offering two different output transformer primary impedances for slightly different feel and harmonic content.Like other Ceriatone amps, we have labored carefully to select the finest components to suit the design, and the Expression uses our specially designed and correct specification custom transformers for superior reliability, frequency response, and feel.Head Dimension : 18.75 x 9.5 x 10.75 inches / Actual Weight : 16kgPower Output\t30 WattFeature Overview\tSingle channelVolume, Treble, Bass, Cut, and Master Volume Controls3-way Bright SwitchHalf Power switch (removes a pair of EL84s and simultaneously rebiases)Fast / Warm Select (selects between high or low plate voltage)Tubes\tPower: 4 x EL84Preamp: 3 x 12AX7/ECC83Rectifier: 5AR4 / GZ34#DR Z #Matchless #Vox #Bad Cat #Two Rock #Fender #Marshall #Mesa #Boutique #HiWatt #AC30"
