Car already has new the steel gear box which replaced by dealer under TSB 08-003-21,  huge improvement on handling.  I purchased Mopar Max Care warranty plan,  it will last until 5/5/2025 or 60,000 miles.  That\u2019s another four years bumper to bumper warranty,  it should be transferable.   The windshield is crack now but I will have it fix before the sale.  Kbb private party average price is $48000 without all the upgrade.  With the upgrade it should be priced $59000 without the Mopar max care.   What I am asking is very reasonable.  Please contact me only when you are ready to buy.  I am not rushing to sell it.  Car is still financing through Patelco Credit union,  we can finish the transaction there.   Upgrade parts list are below,  I also have most of the stock parts if you want them.

These were only made for a short time: 1981 - 1983It was serviced by Pete Cage last year, he replaced the hard-wired speaker cable with a 'proper' speaker out  which looks factory. Has the original vinyl Cover and original speaker. There are no rips, stains, tears.  The preamp tubes are GE 12ax7a's.  Pete said the power tubes are Sylvania 6VGT's with the Fender Logo.  When I had it serviced he put everything he replaced in a baggie and gave it back to me.  Once I got it back from him it sounded better than ever - it's a very complex clean tone with no noise or hash.Such a great clean tone at comfortable home volumes and it will also get loud. Doesn't break up much beyond crunch with my Les Paul unless you pull the mid boost.$70 - Eminence GA10-SC64 10 20-Watt 8 Ohm Replacement Speaker          This speaker is in pristine condition. It was installed for a couple of weeks and carefully taken out          (stored in a box). No issues of any kind."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

It is openhole, inline G, C foot and was restored by Daniel Deitch in San Francisco.The sound is warm and sweet and has nothing to do with the volume of the 21st century.It comes in the original case."
