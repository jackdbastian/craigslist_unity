It was purchased for $2100, worn only once, and has been dry cleaned after the wedding.  Only alternations made to the dress are added cups for bra support, and the tailor brought in the sides a little bit around the waist and upper torso.  The dress color is ivory over nude.The dress is the original length since my wife is 5'9, so there was no hemming needed!  We will also include a veil ($200+tax) and adjustable petticoat, both purchased new and worn only once.The attached pictures are the actual photo of the dress worn on the day of the wedding.  I've also attached a few online pictures found in the following link containing more information about the dress: https://www.theknot.com/fashion/samantha-v1606-ivoire-by-kitty-chen-wedding-dressThanks for looking!"

The dress has a beautiful train of 5 feet or so and my favorite part is the small buttons that run all the way from the hip area, where the corset was tied, down to the end of the train.My review: I wanted a dress I can move around in and a dress that does not have to be pulled up in the bust area again and again. This dress was amazing. Once it was tied on me it never moved and I could easily have a full meal. It was extremely comfortable. Anja : )"

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Just passed Smog. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible and in total cost over $1500). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5000 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
