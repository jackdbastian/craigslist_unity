Very rare, heavy vintage pea coat.  needs dry cleaning as it has been hanging in my closet for a while and is dusty more than anything.Date says 1955, and I assume that is the mfg. date.  I bought it in the 70's and it served me well.  One pocket lining is torn, but you can't see it from the outside.  also there are some wear marks in the collar.  the pictures make it look more gray than it actually is.  It is very dark blue almost black.  I would call it a mens large."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "This is about a ten year old Lame Horse banjo made by luthier Chris Jenkins in Texas. https://lamehorse.net/ He builds very fancy and quite expensive guitars ($7000 +) and occasionally does a banjo. I bought this one new directly from Chris at the luthiers convention in Santa Rose about ten years ago. It is an open back banjo with a 12 block style maple pot and neck.  It is very loud and bright sounding. It has a frailing scoop and a single coordinator rod, five piece neck and has a very easy action. Quite ornamental with exotic woods and inlay up and down the neck. It is in excellent condition with no damage. Mary Cox has hers for sale currently for $2300  plus shipping from Florida on the Banjo Hangout. She is famous, I am not. Reasonable offers accepted, forget low ballers as I do not need to sell it. Comes with a sturdy bump case. No trades, cash only."
