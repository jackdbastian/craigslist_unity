However, selling this in an AS IS condition, as there are a few things that need some work:*Needs either a new catalytic converter or O2 sensor before it would pass another smog test (but current one valid until Sept)*Front bumper needs new screws to attach it to carriage (currently using some duct tape, functional but not pretty)*Tear on leather of Driver's seat*Sun roof doesn't openiVIN Report Summary:This vehicle's market value is $6,544.This vehicle is estimated to have 168,000 miles on the odometer.Projected depreciation: $976 in 5 years."

                "description": "Looking to mostly trade this 75' Fender Vibrosonic (unless you have some ridiculous cash offer that I couldn't refuse. I suppose I would consider a straight sale).This amp is the definition of loud and heavy. Pedal steel players swear by it and blues / rock guitarist enjoy it for it's volume level (you'll have no issues competing against any other musician on stage or at the jam space).It's loud and it doubles as a boat anchor. Luckily it has wheels so you can cart it around. This is the rarer version with the Cerwin Vega 15 speaker. It also doubles as a whole body massage machine when turned up to full volume. This is the definition of feeling the music because it rattles your bones. Not for the faint of hearts. Since I am a faint heart, I am looking to trade this beast for a guitar. Preferably USA made, the Gibsons, Fenders, PRS, Heritage ect. Also would consider high end Japanese made guitars. Last year I had it serviced and caps changed, ect. So it has a clean bill of health. Feel free to call me with any trade offers at  five 59-464-00 two 0"

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

All the classic Roland kits and then some...building custom kits is easy and fun with my own sounds.What is the TR-8S? --> Born of the most famous and influential drum machines ever made, the TR-8S combines the best of its Roland heritage with modern production techniques and professional sound design. The result? A forward-thinking, performance-tuned instrument unlike any other. Build your dream kit from the most iconic drum sounds of all time, plus the finest selection of stereo samples from a vast sound library -- or import your own custom samples. Tap, tune and tweak with hands-on controls and production tools that make your patterns move and groove. And why keep this kind of percussive power confined to the studio? The TR-8S was literally made to play live.Transistor RhythmsThe TR-8S has every sound from the most sought-after TR drum machines, with detailed circuit-models of the 808, 606, 909, 707, 727, 626 and even several modified versions. These are not sound-alike sample-packs or mere recordings of TR drum sounds. Each machine is a detailed, down-to-the-circuit-model that sounds and behaves exactly like the original hardware. All these sounds are yours, at your fingertips, and ready to use in your own productions and performances.#Roland #Korg #Moog #DaveSmith #Arturia #Eurorack"
