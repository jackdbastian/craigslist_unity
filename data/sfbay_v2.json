The rarer red snakeskin tolex; upgraded reverb tank and new input jacks. A couple small scuffs but overall great cosmetics. No circuit mods done, however there are plenty online,esp. to make the gain channel better.  The clean channel is classic Fender and a great pedal platform. Get loud enough to keep up with moderate drummer and cuts throught the mix nicely. Original parts included.Class A12 wattsAll tubes test strongPics show optional UK Celestion V30.  Listed price is for the amp with the factory Fender blue-labeled Eminence.  See last couple images.

Really does get that '80's Marshall crunch, even at low volume but also loud enough for gigging at moderate volumes.  All stock except for a 4 Ohm Fender Eminence replacing the original Celestion G12-70. It's a good fit tone wise.  Good cosmetics. Includes original REAN two-button FS and TRS cable.Without footswitch connected, both channels are active so you can mix them together.Plenty of demos, reviews and comps online. Send a phone number if you want to hear back. Not looking for trades."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
