After a tree is removed due to storm damage or urban development Arbor Upcycle will strive to salvage the tree for its timber. The tree is then milled into slabs on-site or at our warehouse. The 3\u201d wood slabs are then stickered and set aside to cure until they are stable enough to build with or sell.Every piece is identified by its true species and neighborhood in San Francisco where the tree once stood.Arbor Upcycle is not only salvaging valuable timber and sequestering carbon off-gassing but also reclaiming some of San Francisco\u2019s oldest residing residents and in doing so is preserving SF\u2019s heritage in the face of a rapidly changing urban landscape.Next time you need a tree removed or see a tree being removed we hope you think of Arbor Upcycle and our mission to sustainably manage our urban forest and contribute to our community.    http://arborupcycle.com/"

                "description": "Unfortunately it is time to pass on my absolutely amazing 2004 Mazda 6 Sport Hatchback! It is in great condition, serviced frequently and well taken care of by our local and trusted mechanic at Advanced Auto in Santa Cruz. Runs perfectly, drove it to Yosemite last week and Anaheim about a month ago with absolutely no problems. Great gas mileage and a comfortable ride for road trips. Always received premium gas and oil changes every 3,000 miles.Completely upgraded the sound system with a 12inch kicker subwoofer and new speakers and amp (Sounds Incredible). I also put in a touchscreen Pioneer center display that is bluetooth capable and has a usb hookup for your phone to charge and play music. I also installed a back-up camera! This car has really been well taken care of and I am sad to see it go but I am in need of something a bit bigger. There are some signs of age as you can see in the seats and body and the text in the center screen is starting to fade a bit (See Photos). But these minor cosmetic blemishes are truly only aesthetic and do not take away from how amazing this car drives. There are no mechanical issues at all, sometimes a bit of oil does burn off the engine resulting in a smell but we have confirmed with our mechanic that there is no underlying issue associated with this. It\u2019s fast and reliable and will get you where you need to go in comfort and style.The price is $5250 Obo and please feel free to reach out with ANY questions or to schedule a test drive!"

In our sealed enclosure, the 10 inch Celestion delivers warm and beautiful mids with a deep and resonant low end articulation. Best for electric instruments, especially when they are overly bright, the 10 inch delivers warm and uncompromising tone. If you already have a 10 inch speaker that you love, or if you are used to the sound of a 10 inch, this is your amp. Combine this with our 12 extension cabinet for staggering power that will easily handle outdoor gigs without a PA system. Key Features:Powerful: 100 watts per channel. 200 watts total when using channel 1 and 2. Toneful: Patented next generation analog technology.Portable: Take it on board the plane and put in the overhead bin.Reliable: Stop fussing with 70 year old unreliable technology and play more!Ultra-Light: This is the second lightest of our combo amps. About as heavy as your guitar in its case.Modular: Combine this with our matching extension speaker, or use your own for outdoor or extremely loud gigs.Flexible: Works with nearly any impedance, or even with the speaker unplugged.Consistent: Our power supply auto-adapts regardless of the voltage the wall is dishing out. Your tone never suffers, even from nightclub voltage.These units usually sell for $1049 plus about $80 for the footswitch. Not a bad deal for $800. Comes with vinyl cover."

All of our instruments, old and new, are set up in our world-class repair shop before we display them in our showroom or advertise them online. When you buy from Keith Holland Guitars, you can rest assured that you're in good hands and that your instrument will be ready to play out of the box.Finnegan's Wake:Ever since Bill Finnegan created the Klon in the early 90's, pedal makers have been scrambling to replicate the magical clear transparent overdrive effect made famous by the pedal. Often imitated and rarely equaled, the Klon remains one of the most talked about pedals of all time. A shroud of mystery continually to surrounds the infamous overdrive. Many strong words have been exchanged between pedal builders, armchair scholars and professional musicians, who spend countless hours a discussing (or debating) just what particular component makes the pedal so good. The black goop, an epoxy resin that obscures the pedal's circuit, only adds to the mystery.All hype aside, its really a great sounding pedal. Its simple, easy to use and extremely versatile. It can act as a simple clean boost or used to get more dirt into your sound. It is a worthwhile investment for someone with a great sounding amp who would like to push it into overdrive territory without losing the natural tone of the amp and guitar. This specific Klon has the Horsie decal and a really low serial # at 492This particular pedal is in Good Condition. There is some scratching and wear to the front and sides of the enclosure and substantial scratching to the bottom. It has been lovingly used and studied by its two principal owners and has been in and around our store's possession ever since Keith was a dealer back in the day."
