Fists wrist from about 6.5 inches to 8 inches in diameter.  It has no damage or defects other than you need someone else to tie it on for you.Be advised I live way up on Mount Tamalpais off of Panoramic Highway above Mill Valley 15 minutes off of the 101. I can be talked into meeting at the Manzanita Parking Lot 40 Shoreline Highway if that is more convenient."

It has a rebuilt engine that was swapped with a B20, still has the VTEC heads, manual transmission, and is a blast to drive. It runs great and I would not think twice to take this car on a long road trip. It has aftermarket suspension and it handles better than a 2008 m3. Shoot me an offer. I have the original seats as well that I can include if you want them as well. The car has a real carbon fiber hood, I put a wrap on it to protect it. It sounds awesome, real throaty for a 4cil, and feels like I'm driving in the original Fast & Furious movie.

Designed specifically to block out unwanted sounds from sides and back, the EHR-D is a microphone designed for loud sound sources, tentatively for drums, horns and guitars. The housing is made for the rough life of being on the road.\u201d Great for isolating an acoustic guitar when recording vocals at same time."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most solid-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

You just can't get a transformer loaded discrete channel with preamp, line amp, sends and EQ for anywhere near this price.Comes with enough new parts to recap a few channels and you can add more channel strips later if you need more.... they come up on ebay every few weeks or so.The 6 individual strips alone often sell for about 125-150 each plus tax and shipping.  The GA80080 Tamura Output Transformers sell for about 60-65 each."
