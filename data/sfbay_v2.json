Reducing the carbon footprint of society by recycling usable bay area trees. Keeping these beautiful specimens out of the landfills helps combat massive sequestered carbon entering our atmosphere.

This is why we call these \u201csecond life logs\u201d .We are addicted to STACKING!We have hundreds of live edge wood slabs available SML, MED, LRG, XL, & XXL sizes.

We can walk you through the entire process. First timers no need to be anxious, this is supposed to be FUN. The #1 comment customers say is \u201cWow it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought, I\u2019m glad you told me to try it\u201d   We aren\u2019t in the furniture business. We are in the heirloom conversation piece business. Each and every wood slab is unique in it\u2019s own way. Our job is complete when we here a \u201cbing\u201d and see a photo come through of you standing proudly by your masterpiece. We don\u2019t call it quits when you drive away from our facility.  My heart is full of gratitude as I continue reflect on the salvaged material we have provided to our customers over the years. Thank you to everyone that has consciously chosen to purchase the foundation of their project from us . My partners and I invest so much heart into recycling mother nature\u2019s artwork and it is an indescribable feeling to have you guys recognize both the beauty and the effort put forth to give these logs a second life. It is so special for us to be a part of your story. Making the decision to spend your hard earned money on something we worked tirelessly to provide is not something we take lightly or for granted. We appreciate you! STACK EM\u2019 UP!!-Eric Christopher                            Process1. Decide on a project2. Measure the designated available space, keeping in mind the sizes of other nearby objects. Keeping things proportional will help your space feel sophisticated & curated rather than out of place or overbearing.3. Come Look! The fun begins here! Everyone\u2019s taste is different so it\u2019s best to complete steps 1 & 2 and then come look at our inventory and see if anything screams \u201cTake me home\u201d Our inventory is constantly changing. I tell customers \u201cour store is like a shoe store. We don\u2019t always have every size/model/color but it might be tomorrow that we bring the desired material in. Our inventory is based on the trees we are able to give a second life to, not the \u201cclick of a button\u201d reorder.4. Price is based on many factors as each boule is unique in it\u2019s own way and each boule is in a different state of its life. The main factors we consider are:-Size (board foot aka volume of material)-Species -Figure-Moisture content-Raw or SurfacedOnce Home 1. Decide on the aesthetic look you want to achieve. Do you want the piece to be rustic or lean towards a clean \u201cscuplted\u201d look?2.Remove the bark. We like to use a \u201ccats paw\u201d and a mallet, working pieces off as large as possible. For hardwoods a draw knife works well.3.Sand, scuplt, and clean-up the edges (if that follows suit towards your desired look. ) If a rustic look is desired you may wish to leave the edge as is.  4.Sand the top & bottom. We generally start at 60 grit, working our way through the grits until at least 400 grit. THIS IS NOT a requirement, just our preference. The higher grits do not only make the wood fibers smoother, they allow the true beauty of the wood to expose itself. The 3D figure is more pronounced and shows a higher level of visual contrast. Some figured woods we sand 1200+ grit. THE FINISH YOU CHOOSE MAY DICTATE WHAT GRIT YOU STOP SANDING AT. Some finish brands call for designated end points wich are usually lower in grit than our preference of 400 grit. Many require a max of 220 grit. Read manufactures directions to see if they specify. Once sanded up to 100 grit we like to then cut ends to size if needed, then continue sanding working our way up through the grits. We sand a bit before cutting to size because it makes for less friction on the saw, which usually helps make a smooth, clean cut.We blow off the slab with compressed air and wipe the entire slab with a tac cloth to remove loose dust, prepping the slab for its finish stage.Choosing a finish.Customers always ask what finish I recommend for their project. My answer: finishing is a riddle only you can solve, knowing what you want it to look like, and howmuch time + money do you want to invest. There is not one does-all finish that I recommend for everyone because each finish has it\u2019s pros and cons and everyone has a different vision of how they want their heirloom to look. I will list several of the common types of finishes and the pros and cons as I see it through my experience. Penetrating Oil - UV StabilizedPros Easy application, very quick rich results showing a high percentage of the figure within the wood, sophisticated matte sheen, Inexpensive, easy touch up maintenance, penetrates fibers deep within the wood protecting integrity, UV sun rays do minimal degradation.Cons Not a developed surface finish. This means spills such as red wine will not be stopped from entering the pores of the wood.2 Part EpoxyPros Shows all hidden figure within the wood. The \u201ctruth serum\u201d for wood. Hard surface, fast build up, strengthens any pith , fills checking, and hardens softwoods. A \u201c5 in 1\u201d type of finish. 4 coats of epoxy is similar to 40 coats of polyurethane.Cons Glossy, less margin for error. generally low UV stabilization, many brands yellow over time when outside in sunlight Polyurethane - Water basedPros Easy clean up,Fast drying, Easy \u201cpowdering up\u201d sanding. Dries faster than oil based polyurethane and can be heavier coats too. Barrier to moisture and spills. Many available sheens- gloss, semigloss, satin, flat, and matte.Cons Not as rich as an oil or an epoxy, more bland. A developed finish is slow building. Each coat takes several hrs to dry and many coats are generally needed to have a \u201cmarble like\u201dend result.Polyurethane - Oil BasedPros Rich, deep coloring . High levels of contrast. Durable. Barrier to moisture and spills. Many available sheens- gloss, semigloss, satin, flat, and matte. Many UV stabilized versions available.Cons Intense fumes, stickier clean up, respirator required , tacky feel compared to water based. Slow building, cannot lay heavy coats. Heavy coating runs risk of \u201cskin over\u201d. The top surface dries, creating a thin layer preventing the off gasing process and leaving a sticky, tacky finish that will never properly dry and cure.Contactphone  Website: www.EricChristopherArt.comemail Eric@ErichChristopherArtFb @EricChristopherArtIg @EricChristopherArt5325 Gravenstein Highway NorthSebastopol, CA 95472Business HoursMon:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMTue:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMWed:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMThu:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMFri:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMSat:\t9:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PMSun:\t9:00 AM \u2013 4:00 PM"

I purchased Mopar Max Care warranty plan,  it will last until 5/5/2025 or 60,000 miles.  That\u2019s another four years bumper to bumper warranty,  it should be transferable.   The windshield is crack now but I will have it fix before the sale.  Kbb private party average price is $48000 without all the upgrade.  With the upgrade it should be priced $59000 without the Mopar max care.   What I am asking is very reasonable.  Please contact me only when you are ready to buy.  I am not rushing to sell it.

These were only made for a short time: 1981 - 1983It was serviced by Pete Cage last year, he replaced the hard-wired speaker cable with a 'proper' speaker out  which looks factory. Has the original vinyl Cover and original speaker. There are no rips, stains, tears.  The preamp tubes are GE 12ax7a's.  Pete said the power tubes are Sylvania 6VGT's with the Fender Logo.  When I had it serviced he put everything he replaced in a baggie and gave it back to me.  Once I got it back from him it sounded better than ever - it's a very complex clean tone with no noise or hash.Such a great clean tone at comfortable home volumes and it will also get loud. Doesn't break up much beyond crunch with my Les Paul unless you pull the mid boost.$70 - Eminence GA10-SC64 10 20-Watt 8 Ohm Replacement Speaker          This speaker is in pristine condition. It was installed for a couple of weeks and carefully taken out          (stored in a box). No issues of any kind."

HERE IS A REVIEW I just received: I have that same model guitar , I have been playing for a very long time and I absolutely love the guitar .I have very fine Martin guitars that are prewar vintage and I find myself reaching for my X-commie most of the time . I perform on stage with my X-commie and it sounds so very , very good . Good luck on your sale I hope someone realizes what a fine guitar it actually is.   Good Luck on your sale .     Chuck  It has a great sound really good action and a nice neck, it looks like the back and sides are maple in any case it has a pretty robust sound for a maple back and sides guitar it's not overly bright and it has a really good bass in addition to a really good treble. Here is part of a Harmony Central (I googled Montana MT-204) review, which I agree completely with:This guitar has incredible sound qualities, from high clear bell like tones to low loud bass and good mid range. i believe it would work well for most any style of music this guitar really projects. everyone who has ever played it has said basically the same thing with a look of surprise, This guitar has great tone! the surprise comes from the fact that nothing about the guitars appearance would suggest that it was anything special.Could DELIVER to greater Rohnert Park Area."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

If You are not familiar with latest series DGX pianos, please read below:Built by one of the worlds Premier manufactures, Yamaha's DGX500 is the first full size (88 key) portable keyboard to use actual piano keys, and it's the flagship in a series of instruments from Yamaha called Portable Grand. It's packed with functions and features designed specifically for new piano users. A large, piano-shaped button in the center of the front panel calls up the keyboard's best piano sound. A piano accompaniment style is automatically chosen and readied if you want it. Next to the piano button is a metronome-shaped button for, of course, a metronome feature.The DGX505 features an extra-high-quality stereo piano sample, general MIDI (GM) compatibility, and a selection of Yamaha's famous XG Lite voices, all of which work in concert to give you remarkably good sound quality. The quality is enhanced by the keyboard's two-way speakers with bass-enhancing ports.Polyphony is the ability for a keyboard to sound multiple tones simultaneously. Some keyboards in this price range have 16-, 24 -or 28-note polyphony; the DGX500 has a full 32-note polyphony so you can play intricate instrumental arrangements and dense musical passages without running out of notes or sounds.When you want to record your playing, just press the front panel's record button, the track button for the track you want to record on, and start playing. It's that easy. When you're done, save your song internally or to the keyboard's 3.5-inch floppy disk drive as a standard MIDI file (SMF) to make it compatible with other general MIDI keyboards as well as most computers. Imagine recording your child's first song onto a disk, placing it in your computer and attaching it to e-mail so friends and family can hear.Call up your favorite style of music like Rock, Big Band, Gospel or Country, press a chord or play Single Finger mode, and the DGX505 will follow you through a piece of music, providing all of the drums, bass, piano, guitar, horn and string parts for you. And even though the DGX505 comes with 135 built-in music styles, the disk drive opens up the ability to load even more. The disk drive will allow you to save and organize your favorite data for years to come. Another feature to simplify song playing is the music database. Pull out your favorite music book, select a song from any of the over 200 songs in the database, and the entire keyboard sets itself up. Start playing and the keyboard will follow your every chord--with no other buttons to press.The DGX505 comes with 100 built-in songs with its songbook feature. But if you've never played before, where do you start? Well, if learning to play music is important to you, the Yamaha Education Suite II, a set of music training functions, makes learning music incredibly easy. Seven types of lessons are available as well as a convenient chord dictionary.And finally, no matter what level of playing ability your at, you'll appreciate being able to build combinations of your favorite sounds. Pressing the Split button divides the instrument into two parts, allowing you to have two different sounds on the keyboard at the same time, like piano on the right and bass on the left. That's when you really appreciate the 88 keys.In addition, Layer mode lets you combine two sounds across the keyboard range. For example, you could layer piano and strings and play both sounds at the same time. With over 600 voices to choose from, the combinations are only limited by your imagination.Full Stereo sound with 2-way speakers -88 full size Touch sensitive keys - Tutorial modes with grading - Tons of great features, too many to list This piano will satisfy even an accomplished pianist with its sophistication and stunning full room filling sound.
