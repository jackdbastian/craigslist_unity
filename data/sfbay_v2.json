It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

Like I've stated before I bought the car with these wheels on so I'm not sure how many miles the motor has but is lower than what is on odometer (I've priced accordingly to the 140k Mile reading)  I am the 3rd owner of the car I bought it from the previous owner who had it sense 20k miles Tire pressure light is on because the 19s have no sensors cheap fix if you want but always kept air in them and never bothered me Clean Title Car runs perfectly I am selling because of job opportunity I've came across in SF need something better on gas and automatic You can contact me at 408 204 90 two nine Thanks - MichaelI do not need help sellingNo trades Lowballers will be ignored"

These are among those known as \u201clawsuit guitars,\u201d vintage instruments from that era that were well-made copies of famous American guitars.The pickups in it are humbuckers from a more recent Les Paul. (The knobs are also from a newer Gibson.) It\u2019s a versatile instrument, plays well, and looks great. There is visual evidence of some cracks in the face, which I\u2019ve highlighted in a couple of the photos. None seems to propagate through the face, and given that this is a plywood instrument, they don\u2019t appear to pose any serious problem to the integrity of the guitar.It comes with a nice hard case. If you are looking for a good jazz guitar, but aren\u2019t prepared to spend the thousands that they typically cost, this is a great alternative.I can\u2019t take trades, please don\u2019t offer."

They are just a couple of years old, sealed, and thus as good as new.These are no longer made so are hard to find. Martin was using Cleartone for the coating at this point, but since then they have formulated their own in-house coating which they now call Lifespan 2.0. I have not tried those strings so do not know how they compare. Perhaps because no licensing fees are involved, they are a bit cheaper.These sold for $19 each and sets of 3 would typically go for over $40. I scoured a site named after a famous Brasilian river to get an idea of what a fair price would be. The posted price is for three sets as it is an unopened box."

                "description": "Since you see this ad now, it means that Deep Mind 12 is STILL AVAILABLE.Behringer's famous first analog synth, Deep Mind 12. True analog, 12-voice poly, 4x effects engines, 8x modulation matrix, 1024 patches onboard. Commonly known as Juno on steroids, the modern incarnation of Juno-106 (for the look and bunch of buttons and sliders), it's actually closer to more advanced Juno-60 and JX series. Think JX-10 with all these Juno sliders and  a PG-800 programmer built in. I had and have most of classic analog polysynths, the last one was JX-10 with Vecoven upgrade (cost me over $1300), but even that one doesn't come close to DM12 in sound, features and ease of use. Nothing can beat the feeling of just grabbing a slider and adjusting the value right away, instead of recalling parameter first, then adjusting it, then recalling another, like on JX. You can even play with two or more sliders at once, like cutoff and resonance. There's no way you can do it on any JX.12-voice polyphony does make the difference, you'll never have cut notes as it happens with 6-voice synths like Juno, JX-8P or Polysix.DM12 is analog fanatics' heaven: everything you wished an old Juno or JX had is here, already implemented. IMHO it's the dream analog polysynth: plenty of sliders on surface for instant tweaking like on Junos and Jupiters, and a large graphic display for in-depth editing (no external programmer or software editors are needed). DM12 has a lot more editable parameters than surface allows, so combination of physical sliders for most critical parameters and on-screen menus for everything else is the best, like for effects parameters (it has no less than 4 separate effects engines made by TC Electronics, makers of legendary studio rack effect units like 2290, M-One and D-Two). Plus, an insane 1024 memories onboard (instead 32 to128 on classics) make it quite usable even for live performances. I'd take it over Nord Lead, Novation Peak or Prophet-6 any day!DM12 are becoming rare, since they are no longer produced, and Behringer now is focusing on producing the exact copies of the classic synthesizers. DM12 is an original design, and while it has a lot of layout and sonic similarities with Junos, it's far more advanced and superior to all of them, in a small package with solid all-metal design.  Watch videos for sound samples, more detailed overview of features and comparisons to classic synths.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynm44MeqPfk&feature=emb_logoVery detailed tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So8B6HJ2chQThis DM12 is in great shape, practically new, not even a single scratch anywhere. Selling only because I mostly play live and need more universal synth like Kronos or Montage. My price is fair: they are no longer produced and becoming rare (especially in new condition like mine). Be way of online buys: some sellers won't tell you everything, and in case of problems you'll be paying for return shipment anyway, IF seller accepts returns (most don't).Low-ball offers: No reply means that your offer went straight to trash. I don't need to know how much they are on eBay, or that somebody is selling it for less or is willing to give it to you for free: if he does, go and get that one.Thanks for looking!"
