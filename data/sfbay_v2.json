                "description": "The EL 36-100 Direct Burial Exit Loop is used in installations under concrete, asphalt or gravel roads and the wire used is UL 493 certified and designed for burial application. BD Loops - Exit Loop - 6' X 12' Direct Burial Performed Loops with 100' Lead  Used for installations under concrete, asphalt, pavers, or gravel roads. The most common installation is the loop tied directly to the rebar before concrete is poured. Wire is UL 493 certified designed for a direct burial application.Unlike loops wrapped through PVC, The BD Loops Direct Burial Loop does not have an air pocket resulting in fewer repeat service calls due to phantom detections caused by ground vibration. Built with a high quality solid 14AWG wire out performing other preformed loops with twice as much copper per foot and increased tensile strength.Solid 14AWG wire also results in the direct burial loop being very ridged giving the installer the opportunity to easily set-up and layout the loop and prevents the loop from falling in-between the rebar patter. Twisted jacketed lead-in prevents \u201ccoil back\u201d from normal twisted lead-in, preventing wasted time untangling lead-in wires. The loop wire has arrows indicating the direction of current allowing easy understanding of phasing.Each direct burial loop comes with an installation kit including easy to understand instructions, cable ties for installation on top of redbar, ground stakes for under gravel roads, and stickers for easy identification after the loops have been installed.            Feature\tBenefitsThicker 14-gauge loop wire, 4 times more copper than 20-gauge wire.\tMore copper means a better performing loop and increased tensile strength.UL 493 Direct burial rated loop wire.\tInsurance the right product is being used for the job resulting in an immense lifespanLoops sold as a kit.\tSupplied instructions, ground stakes, cable ties, and loop labels.Pre-phased at the factory.\tSaves time and prevents confusion when installing two loops to one detector.Soldered connections\tEnsure top performance over time.Flex yoke design pre-fitted with \u00bd inch PVC coupler.\tSaves installation time and material cost.No air pocket in loop wire design.\tWill not float to surface during a concrete pour and also eliminates faults trips due to ground vibrations.Compact size and reduced weight.\tSaves on shipping cost and warehouse space."

It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

                "description": "The \u201cDual-Tone\u201d 1 x 12 combo amplifier is the undeniable rock star of the mid 60\u2019s Supro amplifier lineup. Vintage 1624T amps have been sought-after for decades because they embody the most desirable aspects of the Supro sound. As the Dual-Tone\u2019s volume knob is turned beyond noon, a fat and compressed clean tone evolves into an immediately recognizable grind that remains articulate and listenable even when turned up to full blast.This 24-Watt, 1 x 12 tube combo can easily be driven to glorious saturation at a manageable gigging volume while retaining exceptional clarity and bandwidth, at any level of gain. This amp\u2019s unique mojo is largely defined by the use of 6973 power tubes in the amplifier\u2019s output stage. These robust 9-pin tubes were employed extensively in the mid- and low-power Supro amps made 50 years ago. 6973 tubes look like EL84s but they deliver a distinctly American voice that has been missing from the world of tube amplifiers for far too long.The Dual-Tone\u2019s linkable channels each sport volume and tone controls as well as a shared tremolo circuit. Plugging into IN 1+2 links both preamp channels in parallel for double the input signal and double the gain. This clever topology lets you hit the power amp as hard as necessary and even allows \u201cchannel switching\u201d in its purest form, using a simple A/B switch.The 1964 reissue Supro Dual-Tone\u2019s vintage-correct, lightweight cabinet\u2014combined with our breathtaking custom 12\u201d Supro speaker\u2014kicks out surprisingly plump low end with all the detailed midrange and high end articulation that defines the Supro tone players have been chasing for decades. Loud enough to gig with a band, yet easy to haul around town, the Supro Dual-Tone is the perfect small club and recording amplifier. This amp has the long lost tone, so Ramble and Bring It on Home.This units was used just a couple of times in studio... maybe 1 hr of time on it so it is basically brand new.Comes with heavy Duty CoverPlease reply with your contact phone number.

                "description": "Greetings. You have a chance to buy a great upright piano manufactured by a world-famous Chickering company,  that has been founded BEFORE Steinway.  This upright piano is from 1970s. We are consolidating rooms at our small music school, and now there are too many instruments in one office. Imagine that the piano has been recently TUNED and regulated.  You'll only need to hire your movers. No stairs in the building Chickering has been  famous for many decades before getting sold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4yfS1bEHz8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SylNUF5510E By the way, in the same room, we have also two Chickering grand pianos, which we use for teaching. You can see how much we are fond of this make!"
