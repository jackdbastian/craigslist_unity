These have a 100% fur lining 15% nylon fourchette and were made in the Philippines according to the tag in the left glove. The fur lining is luxuriously soft and is a mix of browns, grays, and white. I believe the letter B is the size. The gloves are approximately 10 long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening. They are in very excellent cosmetic condition with just a few small blemishes as shown.------Please call, text, or email anytime.Thank you,Ed"

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

All of our instruments, old and new, are set up in our world-class repair shop before we display them in our showroom or advertise them online. When you buy from Keith Holland Guitars, you can rest assured that you're in good hands and that your instrument will be ready to play out of the box.Matchless aficionados know that the 90's were a particularly great time for the company. These amps were painstakingly hand-made with high quality parts and insane attention to detail. This '98 HC 30 is a perfect example of the unmatched build quality. This amp is surprisingly loud for a 30watt amp. It has tons of headroom and the four EL84 tubes deliver a punchy Vox like chime. The Master knob, when activated via a push/pull, can be used to dial in additional tones. I like to turn the Master down low and crank the volume for some surprisingly gritty overdrive.Overall the Head is in Very Good Condition. There are some cosmetic imperfections such as dings and discoloration scattered around the tolex. The knob that adjusts the Ohms has been replaced at some point. Otherwise the amp is in perfect working condition.Power Adaptor Not Included"

I recently had it fully serviced with new tubes and a full cleaning.  The channel switching feature no longer works, but all inputs work in parallel.  I tend to use it fairly clean but close to breaking up and then drive it harder with pedals.  The distortion also sounds great for recording when driven a bit harder!This thing is a beast and weighs in around 80 pounds but has a truly amazing tone.  Sounds especially awesome with telecasters.Price is firm at $600, which is a total steal considering it was just serviced (fresh tubes!) and is in the best shape of its life."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

Tons of great sounds: pianos, string, organs, flutes, brass etc etc etc. Built in speakers, MIDI, input for headphones. Power supply is included.  price only  $349  in CASH  or PAYPAL . If you see this add it means the piano is availabletel.   If You are not familiar with latest series DGX pianos, please read below:Built by one of the worlds Premier manufactures, Yamaha's DGX500 is the first full size (88 key) portable keyboard to use actual piano keys, and it's the flagship in a series of instruments from Yamaha called Portable Grand. It's packed with functions and features designed specifically for new piano users. A large, piano-shaped button in the center of the front panel calls up the keyboard's best piano sound. A piano accompaniment style is automatically chosen and readied if you want it. Next to the piano button is a metronome-shaped button for, of course, a metronome feature.The DGX505 features an extra-high-quality stereo piano sample, general MIDI (GM) compatibility, and a selection of Yamaha's famous XG Lite voices, all of which work in concert to give you remarkably good sound quality. The quality is enhanced by the keyboard's two-way speakers with bass-enhancing ports.Polyphony is the ability for a keyboard to sound multiple tones simultaneously. Some keyboards in this price range have 16-, 24 -or 28-note polyphony; the DGX500 has a full 32-note polyphony so you can play intricate instrumental arrangements and dense musical passages without running out of notes or sounds.When you want to record your playing, just press the front panel's record button, the track button for the track you want to record on, and start playing. It's that easy. When you're done, save your song internally or to the keyboard's 3.5-inch floppy disk drive as a standard MIDI file (SMF) to make it compatible with other general MIDI keyboards as well as most computers. Imagine recording your child's first song onto a disk, placing it in your computer and attaching it to e-mail so friends and family can hear.Call up your favorite style of music like Rock, Big Band, Gospel or Country, press a chord or play Single Finger mode, and the DGX505 will follow you through a piece of music, providing all of the drums, bass, piano, guitar, horn and string parts for you. And even though the DGX505 comes with 135 built-in music styles, the disk drive opens up the ability to load even more. The disk drive will allow you to save and organize your favorite data for years to come. Another feature to simplify song playing is the music database. Pull out your favorite music book, select a song from any of the over 200 songs in the database, and the entire keyboard sets itself up. Start playing and the keyboard will follow your every chord--with no other buttons to press.The DGX505 comes with 100 built-in songs with its songbook feature. But if you've never played before, where do you start? Well, if learning to play music is important to you, the Yamaha Education Suite II, a set of music training functions, makes learning music incredibly easy. Seven types of lessons are available as well as a convenient chord dictionary.And finally, no matter what level of playing ability your at, you'll appreciate being able to build combinations of your favorite sounds. Pressing the Split button divides the instrument into two parts, allowing you to have two different sounds on the keyboard at the same time, like piano on the right and bass on the left. That's when you really appreciate the 88 keys.In addition, Layer mode lets you combine two sounds across the keyboard range. For example, you could layer piano and strings and play both sounds at the same time. With over 600 voices to choose from, the combinations are only limited by your imagination.Full Stereo sound with 2-way speakers -88 full size Touch sensitive keys - Tutorial modes with grading - Tons of great features, too many to list This piano will satisfy even an accomplished pianist with its sophistication and stunning full room filling sound.  Yet, its simple enough to turn on and begin playing for even the youngest beginner.  Read any reviews on-line and owners just rave about it.    The piano is in excellent condition and works 100%.  Its includes the power cord and the foot petal.  It will be professionally packed for shipping.  Any questions or concerns, feel free to email.  Original Retail price was $1169.95 and that was a steal for this piano."
