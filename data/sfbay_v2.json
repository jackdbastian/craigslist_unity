Runs, drives, shifts great.Front wheel drive with automatic transmission.I am the third owner, the first two were in the same family and took good care of the car. I bought the car for a family member to use and they put around 2k miles in 5 months but they have since decided to go in a different direction as their needs have changed. In my care I have changed the oil, transmission fluid & filter, alternator (was original), added weatherproof floor mats, fixed the broken door lock actuators (typical), added a bluetooth adapter w/ mic to the stereo (replaces the CD changer), and had a second key made with remote entry. Has the Lexus premium stereo which sounds great, AC blows cold. The tires are in good shape with plenty of life left. The front seats are worn, I have a set of covers that are included but I never got around to installing. The title is clean, in my name and I have it in hand. Passed smog 5/23. Registration is current, expires in Sept. Carfax is clean and I can email it to you. I am asking $4900. Text or call and leave voicemail -  . Cash Only! Located in Oakland near the zoo."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."

                "description": "Selling this beautiful, near-mint condition Port City Pearl Mini Combo Guitar amp because I'm simply not playing much anymore and am doing more studio work. This is the smaller version of the famous Pearl amp. The smaller and lighter enclosure paired with the Jensen speaker provides substantial weight reduction for players who need an amp with a smaller footprint that won\u2019t hurt your back. It is much lighter but just as powerful (50 Watts) with tons of clean headroom. Expertly made by hand, this is the best amp I have ever owned. Specs:- Interactive Treble, Middle, and Bass controls- Bright Switch for High-end Frequency Tone Shaping- High and low Inputs- TAD matched 6L6 (x2 in 50W, x4 in 100W)- JJ ECC83 \u2013 Preamp- JJ ECC81 \u2013 Effects Loop- JJ ECC83 \u2013 Phase Inverter- JJ GZ34 Rectifier (100 Watt is rectified with silicon diodes)- USA Heyboer Transformers- Tube Buffered Effects Loop- External speaker jack- 50 Watts Output- 2 / 4 / 8 Ohm Impedance Switch- Made of pine rather than birch. (To lighten the weight.)- Loaded with a Jensen Jet Tornado speaker. (Lightweight neodymium speaker.)- Smaller enclosure (23 x 19 x 10)- Updated faceplate graphicsThe tubes, chassis, circuit, and features are all the same.) It weighs around 35 lbs. This is the perfect grab-and-go clean pedal platform amp! Includes custom-made cover made by Custom Amp Covers with side pockets. I also had Fender tilt-back legs professionally installed. No trades. Will accept cash, PayPal, or Venmo. Local buyers only. Good luck!"
