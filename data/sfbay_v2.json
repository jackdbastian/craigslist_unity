BD Loops - Exit Loop - 6' X 12' Direct Burial Performed Loops with 100' Lead  Used for installations under concrete, asphalt, pavers, or gravel roads. The most common installation is the loop tied directly to the rebar before concrete is poured. Wire is UL 493 certified designed for a direct burial application.Unlike loops wrapped through PVC, The BD Loops Direct Burial Loop does not have an air pocket resulting in fewer repeat service calls due to phantom detections caused by ground vibration. Built with a high quality solid 14AWG wire out performing other preformed loops with twice as much copper per foot and increased tensile strength.Solid 14AWG wire also results in the direct burial loop being very ridged giving the installer the opportunity to easily set-up and layout the loop and prevents the loop from falling in-between the rebar patter. Twisted jacketed lead-in prevents \u201ccoil back\u201d from normal twisted lead-in, preventing wasted time untangling lead-in wires. The loop wire has arrows indicating the direction of current allowing easy understanding of phasing.Each direct burial loop comes with an installation kit including easy to understand instructions, cable ties for installation on top of redbar, ground stakes for under gravel roads, and stickers for easy identification after the loops have been installed.            Feature\tBenefitsThicker 14-gauge loop wire, 4 times more copper than 20-gauge wire.\tMore copper means a better performing loop and increased tensile strength.UL 493 Direct burial rated loop wire.\tInsurance the right product is being used for the job resulting in an immense lifespanLoops sold as a kit.\tSupplied instructions, ground stakes, cable ties, and loop labels.Pre-phased at the factory.\tSaves time and prevents confusion when installing two loops to one detector.Soldered connections\tEnsure top performance over time.Flex yoke design pre-fitted with \u00bd inch PVC coupler.\tSaves installation time and material cost.No air pocket in loop wire design.\tWill not float to surface during a concrete pour and also eliminates faults trips due to ground vibrations.Compact size and reduced weight.\tSaves on shipping cost and warehouse space."

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

                "description": "Peavey Special 130. Made in the USA 130 watt solid state amp. Loud if demanded. Working fine. This is not one of those inexpensive Peavey practice amps. It is a high powered serious unit. The Tolex is very good condition. I do not have the footswitch so I pull the phone jack out of the rear footswitch input jack to actuate the distortion channel. I cleaned all the pots two times from the inside and outside. The push/pull high EQ knob still has a bit of a static noise when adjusted. It makes no noise if you are not adjusting it. The two right knobs and grill cloth are not Peavey produced. This is a fairly heavy duty amp. The power transformer is massive. It looks like it is on casters but the wheels are a small dolly that is not part of the sale.  Leave your number with your response and I will call you."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.

                "description": "AMAZING EASY TO PLAY CAN'T BEAT TAYLOR $800 OBO INCLUDES A ROADRUNNER HARD SHELL CASE Taylor 150e Dreadnought 12-String Acoustic-Electric Guitar Naturalitem# 1500000279193Taylor's 100 Series, which now includes the 150e 12-String Dreadnought acoustic-electric guitar, makes a great guitar-playing experience accessible to everyone with these real wood instruments. For people taking the first or next step in their musical journey, these instruments promise to accelerate players' growth and enhance their enjoyment. Taylor's famous neck profile combined with a 1 11/16 nut width make it easy for developing players to form barre chords. The 150e 12-String Dreadnought acoustic-electric guitar comes with a durable, 600-denier nylon gig bag with double-stitched seams and reinforced stress points, built by Taylor for an optimal fit.Body ShapeThe Dreadnought is one of the most traditional acoustic guitar shapes. Taylor's version has been refined to blend its trademark robust low-end tone with a snappy midrange and brilliant treble notes, producing a pleasing balance of power and articulation. If you're a flatpicker or strummer who likes to dig in on lead or rhythm, the Dreadnought should serve you well.TonewoodsA guitar's top is the primary filter and distributor of vibrating string energy through the guitar, which means it has a huge impact on its sound. Sitka Spruce is the most prevalent guitar top wood of the modern era. It blends stiffness and elasticity in just the right proportions which translates into broad dynamic range with crisp articulation. The arched back of the guitar generates more sound from a small-bodied instrument, and using layered wood back and sides create a sturdy yet receptive platform for the vibrating string energy sent by the guitar's top. Layered wood is also less susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity, making it an excellent choice for players who travel with their instruments or simply require more durability.ElectronicsTaylor's ES2 is a revolutionary pickup design that delivers the latest in Taylor\u2019s ongoing innovation in acoustic guitar amplification. The heart of the Expression System 2 is Taylor\u2019s patented behind-the-saddle pickup, which features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors. Because the pickup doesn't sit under the saddle, the bottom of the saddle comes in full contact with the bridge, allowing all the nuance of the guitar's tone to come through clearly whether playing acoustically or plugged-in. The location of the sensors enables a more dynamic range of acoustic sound to be captured than ever before while playing plugged-in. Together with Taylor\u2019s custom-designed \u201cprofessional audio\u201d-grade preamp, this system produces exceptional amplified tone and responsiveness. On stage through a PA, plugged into your favorite acoustic amplifier, or direct into recording software, the Expression System 2 faithfully conveys the voice of your Taylor guitar. The Taylor Expression System 2 operates through a proprietary 9-volt battery compartment and easy-to-use volume, and active bass and treble controls.Other FeaturesTaylor is famous for its 12-string guitars due to their ease-of-play, their stability, their intonation and their overall tone. The Taylor Neck's slim neck profile and precision system allow precise and low action, resulting in the most comfortable handfeel found in a 12-string. The Taylor 150e is Taylor's most affordable 12-string to date, and the same attributes that make a high-end Taylor 12-string great are found on the 150e.The Taylor DifferenceWhat sets Taylor Guitars apart? Unmatched build quality, the most stable and playable necks, a vast array of tonal options, eco-conscious and ethically-sourced raw materials, and a lifetime of service and support.Specifications:BodyBody type: Taylor DreadnoughtCutaway: NoTop wood: Solid Sitka SpruceBack & sides: Layered WalnutBracing pattern: 100 Series 12-String Bracing PatternBody finish: Satin VarnishOrientation: Right-HandedNeckNeck shape: Standard Taylor 12-String ProfileNut width: 1-7/8 (47.6mm)Fingerboard: Genuine African EbonyNeck wood: Hard Rock MapleScale length: 25-1/2Number of frets: 20Neck finish: Satin VarnishElectronicsPickup/preamp: Expression System 2 Professional Audio-GradeBrand: TaylorConfiguration: Behind-the-Saddle Transducer with Adjustable SensorsPreamp EQ: Volume, Active Bass and TrebleFeedback filter: Onboard Phase SwitchTuner: NoneOtherHeadstock overlay: West African EbonyTuning machines: Die-cast Chrome Mini Tuners with Chrome ButtonsBridge: West African EbonySaddle & nut: Micarta Wave Saddle; NuBone NutNumber of strings: 12Special features: n/aCase: Deluxe Taylor Gig BagAccessories: None"

This upright piano is from 1970s. We are consolidating rooms at our small music school, and now there are too many instruments in one office. Imagine that the piano has been recently TUNED and regulated.  You'll only need to hire your movers. No stairs in the building Chickering has been  famous for many decades before getting sold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4yfS1bEHz8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SylNUF5510E By the way, in the same room, we have also two Chickering grand pianos, which we use for teaching.
