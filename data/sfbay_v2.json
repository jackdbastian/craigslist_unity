It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing!

The car was T-boned on the drivers side (mostly fixed) and I'm helping my neighbor sell it. Please read the WHOLE ad. It was T-boned about 2 weeks ago with a hit and runs driver (please see pictures) mostly affecting the drivers side 2 doors. I was able to locate the exact same color doors and drove to Rancho Cordova yesterday to purchase them and get them installed. They only spent 15 minutes installing them and $900 later, it looks better but the damage to the body/frame was more significant than I/we thought. This is a body man special. You can see from the pictures that the base of the door frame was pushed in about 2 inches and will need to be pulled out/pushed down in order for the door(s) to line up perfectly. The front door closes flush but the rear door only closes to the first click and I don't want to push too hard on it. This would be great for someone handy or perfect for a body shop to quite easily fix. Aside from what was stated above, the paint is starting to fade from the sun on the front hood. That's it! Now for the good stuff.. Runs absolutely perfectClean title130,904 original milesThe hybrid battery was replaced on January 28th, 2019 at a mileage of 85,858. (Yes, I have documentation)Smog passed and completed for the sale 05/02/2021Current registrationTop of the line Package 6.

Very simply and straightforward and I will happily accompany you to AAA for the transfer if that's a concern. Full disclosure so there's no surprises. No big deal.This car runs and drives like a dream. Absolutely as straight as an arrow on the freeway. With the replaced hybrid battery and low mileage, she should continue to run well for the years to come. Comes with a full tank of gas!Looking for the right buyer to offer $3500 obo for this little gem. Again, she runs and drives like new but just needs a little love getting the rear door to line up correctly. (Again, I've included both before and after pictures of how it looked after the accident and how it looks now that it's been mostly fixed. The new doors are installed)Please e-mail and include your phone number. Please put I read the whole ad in the subject heading. Thank you."

This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners.
