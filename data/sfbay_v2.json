                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most solid-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The Famous FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Subtle striping at the soundhole is nice touch. Low action and great intonation, it's got a classic ukulele sound. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail.Reasonable offers are welcome."

This would also be a great investment unlike a new sax that would depreciate in value.This sax plays nice and has that tone the Mark VI is famous for. Original finish but does show slight wear, but very nice for it\u2019s age. No dents & the serial numbers do match, and the original case is in very good condition. Please email with any questions."

All the classic Roland kits and then some...building custom kits is easy and fun with my own sounds.What is the TR-8S? --> Born of the most famous and influential drum machines ever made, the TR-8S combines the best of its Roland heritage with modern production techniques and professional sound design. The result? A forward-thinking, performance-tuned instrument unlike any other. Build your dream kit from the most iconic drum sounds of all time, plus the finest selection of stereo samples from a vast sound library -- or import your own custom samples. Tap, tune and tweak with hands-on controls and production tools that make your patterns move and groove. And why keep this kind of percussive power confined to the studio? The TR-8S was literally made to play live.Transistor RhythmsThe TR-8S has every sound from the most sought-after TR drum machines, with detailed circuit-models of the 808, 606, 909, 707, 727, 626 and even several modified versions. These are not sound-alike sample-packs or mere recordings of TR drum sounds. Each machine is a detailed, down-to-the-circuit-model that sounds and behaves exactly like the original hardware. All these sounds are yours, at your fingertips, and ready to use in your own productions and performances.#Roland #Korg #Moog #DaveSmith #Arturia #Eurorack"
