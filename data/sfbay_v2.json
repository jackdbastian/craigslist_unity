Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height *Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

As much as I would love to keep it, it really just doesn't make sense for me to keep it any longer.It's loaded with a pair of Celestion Creambacks on the top, and an x pattern of G12H100s and Vintage 30s on the bottom. It's wired for an 8 ohm load.While the cab is in far from perfect cosmetic condition, as you can see in the pictures, it's in perfectly sound physical shape, and it looks great from the front.This cabinet is a real presence at gigs (whenever we get around to having those again) and would really work well for a stoner or doom band that's going for a Sleep/High on Fire-esque stage presence. It also acts as its own monitor in a sense, as the top speakers are so close to ear level that you should never really have an issue hearing yourself.I've used this cab with a lot of different amps, and it makes each one sound amazing. It's also a very loud cab, and it can handle just about anything you can throw at it. I'm honestly sad to see it go, but I would rather sell it to someone that will use it than to have it sit in my studio.The cab comes with casters. I can't remember the exact dimensions off the top of my head, but its something like 56 tall, 32 wide and between 12 and 14 deep. Point is that this won't fit in every car - just something to be aware of.I'm open to trades. I like cool guitars - something metal oriented with a floyd, or a jazzmaster... try your luck. Not into traditional  strats or teles though. I also love amps. let me know what you have, it may be just what I'm looking for."

                "description": "Fender Concert 2-channel 60-watt 1x12 amplifier. This amp has been my go-to amplifier for a couple of years now for gigging and rehearsal. Gets loud, and has a great sound. The overdrive channel is my favorite part of this amplifier because it allowed me to dial in a bit of dirt at lower volumes for small venues. However, these amps are famously revered for their normal channel. Many many players love the clean channel and claim the overdrive is less than desirable, so I supposed everything is subjective.I'm selling it because I've somehow acquired four amplifiers (gasp), and I need to thin out the herd. As best I can tell, this amp was built between 1981 and 1987. It was part of the Rivera era at Fender. The amp has been good to me over the last couple years, but it's time to release it into the wild.Asking $700, or best offer. Amp has caster wheels which is great for gigging. I will also throw in a Mesa Boogie slip cover."

Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
