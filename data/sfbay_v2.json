It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building. In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing! To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

Title is in hand, and in my namePlease read whole ad before calling, as many questions can be answered belowClean Carfax Shows:No accidents, 2 owner, Clean Title, accurate mileage20 service records from Acura of Stockton from original owner. The original transmissions went out at 100k. However a 2006/2007 Honda Accord V6 uses the same exact trans, except Honda fixed the fatal flaw (2/3rd gear clutch pack oiling) and they are very dependable. I installed a trans out of a 2007 accord that was 1 owner from Dublin, always maintained at Honda with also 100K on the odometer (came out of a salvaged crash car was hit in rear) This trans should last the life of the car without issue. This is a common swap among CL and TL enthusiasts.Along with trans, around 100K I installed a Genuine  Acura Timing belt and water pump kit with tensioner and seals.  All Factory parts. I also did factory Iridium spark plugs and checked the valve adjustment at that time.All 4 brakes are done recently with e-coated rotors, stoptech pads and flushed performance brake fluid2 new motor mounts, Factory AcuraCoolant replaced and the power steering fluid flushed with Honda fluidNew HID Ballasts and bulbsNow for the goodies $$*Koni Yellow Rebound adjustable Struts at all 4 corners with stock springs at 1 lower height (not too low)*Eibach Sway Bars front and rear with poly bushings* All 4 sway bar end links replaced with HD Moog greasable units*Poly strut rod mounts*Real Deal Comptech Stainless Mufflers and Y pipe (can be showroom polished if wanted)*Air sound/restrictor removed from air box (still smog legal no issue, just throatier sound)*Has TL rims on it as opposed to the factory CL rims which look almost identical except the CL rims get curbed easier and don't have the nice dark metallic background color. *Interior has been double dyna-matted (sound deadening) all along back seat area, both doors completely, trunk *Has custom stereo with a 10 Sub with a JL amp powering it, and a 4 channel rockford fosgate powering door speakers and 6x9s, all quality cables throughout even all the way up to the door speakers*Ceramic 20% tinted windows all the way around, nice privacy but  not so dark can't see out and they are the heat resistant pricey ceramicThis CL Runs and Drives excellent, super clean and tasteful. Handles on rails, super comfortable, and plenty of power along with good gas mileage. Everything works, AC cold, both heated seats work, windows, locks, power seats, everything. The negatives:The air bag recall needs to be done, and the seatbelt receiver replaced (both will be done for free at the dealer, I just never got around to it because its a few cities away)Dings on body (see passenger door) and minor visual defects on exterior (rock chips front bumper) 20 year old black car, its super clean and representable but its also not a complete garage queen.Will need tires soon. The current ones will get you where you need to go but theyre at the end of their life.*Price is absolutely firm, no rush to sell, if you like what you see and read you won't be wasting your time coming to see and but this clean machine.*Cody"

                "description": "Rare 2001 or so Tone King Comet 20 for sale. This amp is like the best Deluxe Reverb you've ever heard (but with more bottom end) + a second lead channel that's more of a tweed tone with the ability to get higher gain crunch at volume. Mark Bartel hand built these amps and it's a thing of beauty visually and tonally. Includes footswitch for channel. I'm selling it because this is... not a bedroom amp. It is surprisingly loud for a 20w 6V6 amp even at low volume settings. If you're in the studio, gigging or in a house by yourself it's amazing. It's also extremely light weight. Here are notes from the Tone King website circa 2001....Comet series are a new generation of Tone King Amplifiers which take the basic Tone King design platform to a higher level of perfection. These amplifiers are a result of many years of intensive development work with the intention of producing the finest sounding, highest quality amplifiers possible. I've achived all of my goals with these amplifiers, which eclipse the highly-regarded older models in tone, quality, and styling. Comet amplifiers produce a clean tone of exceptional warmth, dynamics, and three-dimentional character. The electronics, speaker, and cabinet are precisely tuned to maintain perfect tonal balance, regardless of the type of guitar you use. Overdriven tones range from genuine 'Tweed' tones with soft breakup, touch-sensitive dynamics, and smooth compression, to harmonically-rich, singing, English-style crunch.Everything works perfectly and it's in very good condition as you can tell from the photos. I've also included images from the Guitar Player review in 2001."

                "description": "Pretty little soprano, nice build with super-thin mahogany laminate, but with a sound that will rival most sold-wood ukes. Extremely light, with excellent projection and beautiful resonance. The FS-1 is a Japanese build, identical to the Kiwaya KS-1, but sold only to the Japanese market. This older uke has a Rosewood fingerboard, which you won't find in production any longer...the newer ones are walnut.  Nice, low action and great intonation. Friction tuners. Tiny scratch on the headstock, mark on the first fret - see the photos for detail. One-of-a-kind cloth gig bag included. Reasonable offers are welcome."
