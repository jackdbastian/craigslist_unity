                "description": "Vintage leather suitcase from AR Arflite. Made from top grain cow hide. Purchased May 1, 1949 by my father -- Arnold Carmon Mangle (ACM), who apparently had it monogrammed on the outside near the handle. Snazzy!Brass hardware throughout. Both exterior latches work. They have keyholes, but they're not locked, and I don't have the key. Tan leather exterior is well worn, and the leather has numerous cracks along the top edges. The handle is a hand form-fitting molded plastic. Very comfortable. Probably made from Catalin, and likely considered a high-tech feature for that era.Interior is lined with beige canvas throughout. Very clean. Spaces are smartly divided with latching panel, tension-locked pockets, and a zippered cover overlaying divided sub-compartments. Under the latching panel is a suit/dress compartment with 2 removable custom-designed hangers. The plastic hangars, again probably Catalin, mount on a brass peg within the suitcase to keep them in place during travel. But then standard-sized brass hooks swivel into place once you reach the closet at your destination.Obviously a lot of thought went into this design. I imagine it was a top-of-the-line product at the time. If you're one to eschew rolling luggage in favor of genuine leather from a bygone era, this is the suitcase for you! Give your vintage wardrobe the retro accessory it deserves!"

No accidents, well cared for. Silver with black interior, no dents. Excellent condition. This is my most favorite car I've ever owned! So fun to drive and no gas expense. I'm moving to Hawaii so I have to sell. Purchased from Santa Cruz Toyota in 2019 and have had no issues, it's been an excellent, reliable car. Great for zippin around town. 50 mile range on full charge. Ask any questions that you need to :)"

                "description": "FOR SALE: SISTRUM MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, $60.  Replica of an ancient Sistrum (rattle).  These were used as musical percussion instruments for various rites and ceremonies.  The Sistrum first appeared in the Old Kingdom and became connected to the goddesses Isis and Hathor.  Unfortunately very few exist.  Most of the surviving ones come from the Greco-Roman era.  It\u2019s closest modern equivalent is the tambourine and is used the same way.   The Sistrum has a long handle, a frame with crossbars and small disks that rattle when shaken.  They were made of wood, stone or metal.  The word Sistrum means that which is being shaken.  The Egyptians believed that the Sistrum had magical properties. It is connected with the powers of the Goddess and symbolizes joy, fertility and eroticism.  It was believed that the Sistrum could avert the flooding of the Nile.  One of the most famous depictions of the Sistrum is in the Hathor Temple in Dendera.  You will also see depictions of the Goddess Isis with a symbol of inundation in one hand and a Sistrum in the other. All vintage, antique and used items are sold \u201cas found\u201d and are priced accordingly."
